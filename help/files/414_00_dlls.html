<h1>Using DLL's</h1>

<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</b></i>


<p>
<i><b>Please note that since version 7 there is a new extension mechanism in Game Maker.
You are strongly encouraged to use that extension mechanism, rather than the functions
described in this section. 
See
<a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/extensions" target="_blank">http://www.yoyogames.com/extensions</a>
for details.
These functions are mainly left in for compatibility
with the past.</b></i>


<p>
In those cases were the functionality of GML is not enough for your wishes, 
you can actually extend the possibilities by using plug-ins. A plug-in comes 
in the form of a DLL file (a Dynamic Link Library). In such a DLL file you 
can define functions. Such functions can be programmed in any programming 
language that supports the creation of DLL's (e.g. Delphi, C, C++, etc.) 
You will though need to have some programming skill to do this. Plug-in 
functions must have a specific format. They can have between 0 and 16 
arguments, each of which can either be a real number (double in C) or 
a null-terminated string. (For more than 4 arguments, only real 
arguments are supported at the moment.) They must return either 
a real or a null-terminated string.

<p>
In Delphi you create a DLL by first choosing <b>New</b> 
from the <b>File</b> menu and then choosing DLL. Here 
is an example of a DLL you can use with <i>Game Maker</i> 
written in Delphi. (Note that this is Delphi code, 
not GML code!)

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
library MyDLL;

uses SysUtils, Classes;

function MyMin(x,y:double):double;  cdecl;
begin
  if x&lt;y then Result := x else Result := y;
end;

var res : array[0..1024] of char;

function DoubleString(str:PChar):PChar; cdecl;
begin
  StrCopy(res,str);
  StrCat(res,str);
  Result := res;
end;

exports MyMin, DoubleString;

begin
end.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This DLL defines two functions: <tt>MyMin</tt> that takes two real arguments 
and returns the minimum of the two, and <tt>DoubleString</tt> that 
doubles the string. Note that you have to be careful with memory 
management. That is why I declared the resulting string global. 
Also notice the use of the cdecl calling convention. You can 
either use cdecl or stdcall calling conventions. Once you build 
the DLL in Delphi you will get a file <tt>MyDLL.DLL</tt>. This 
file must be placed in the running directory of your game. 
(Or any other place where Windows can find it.) 

<p>
To use this DLL in <i>Game Maker</i> you first need to specify the 
external functions you want to use and what type of arguments they 
take. For this there is the following function in GML:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>external_define(dll,name,calltype,restype,argnumb,arg1type,arg2type, ...)</b></tt> 
    Defines an external function. dll is the name of the dll file. 
	name is the name of the functions. calltype is the calling convention 
	used. For this use either dll_cdecl or dll_stdcall. restype is the 
	type of the result. For this use either ty_real or ty_string. argnumb 
	is the number of arguments (0-16). Next, for each argument you must 
	specify its type. For this again use either ty_real or ty_string. 
	When there are more than 4 arguments all of them must be of type ty_real.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
This function returns the id of the external function that 
must be used for calling it. So in the above example, at the 
start of the game you would use the following GML code:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  global.mmm = external_define('MyDLL.DLL','MyMin',dll_cdecl,
                                     ty_real,2,ty_real,ty_real);
  global.ddd = external_define('MyDLL.DLL','DoubleString',dll_cdecl,
                                     ty_string,1,ty_string);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now whenever you need to call the functions, you use the following function:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>external_call(id,arg1,arg2,...)</b></tt> 
    Calls the external function with the given id, and the given 
	arguments. You need to provide the correct number of arguments 
	of the correct type (real or string). The function returns
	the result of the external function.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, for example, you would write:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  aaa = external_call(global.mmm,x,y);
  sss = external_call(global.ddd,'Hello');
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you don't need to use the DLL anymore you had better free it.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>external_free(dll)</b></tt> 
    Frees the DLL with the given name. This is in particular necessary if the 
	game should remove the DLL. As long as the DLL is not freed it cannot be 
	removed. Best do this e.g. in an end of game event.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
You might wonder how to make a function in a DLL that does 
something in the game. For example, you might want to create 
a DLL that adds instances of objects to your game. The easiest 
way is to let your DLL function return a string that 
contains a piece of GML code. This string that contains 
the piece of GML can be executed using the GML function

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>execute_string(str,arg0,arg1,...)</b></tt> 
    Execute the piece of code in the string str with the indicated arguments.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively you can let the DLL create a file with a 
script that can be executed (this function can also be 
used to later modify the behavior of a game).

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>execute_file(fname)</b></tt> 
    Execute the piece of code in the file.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now you can call an external function and then execute the resulting string, e.g. as follows:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  ccc = external_call(global.ddd,x,y);
  execute_string(ccc);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In some rare cases your DLL might need to know the handle of the main
graphics window for the game. This can be obtained with the following 
function and can then be passed to the DLL:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>window_handle()</b></tt> 
    Returns the window handle for the main window.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that DLLs cannot be used in secure mode.

<p>
Using external DLLs is an extremely powerful mechanism. 
But please only use it if you know what you are doing.
