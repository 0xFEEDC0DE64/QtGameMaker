<h3>Shared data</h3>

Shared data communication is probably the easiest way to synchronize 
the game. All communication is shielded from you. There is a set of 
1000000 values that are common to all entities of the game (preferably 
only use the first few to save memory). Each entity can set values and 
read values. <i>Game Maker</i> makes sure that each entity sees 
the same values. A value can either be a real or a string. There 
are just two routines:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mplay_data_write(ind,val)</b></tt> 
    write value val (string or real) into location ind (ind between 0 and 1000000).<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_data_read(ind)</b></tt> 
    returns the value in location ind (ind between 0 and 1000000). Initially all values are 0.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
To synchronize the data on the different machines you can either use a 
guaranteed mode that makes sure that the change arrives on the other machine 
(but which is slow) or non-guaranteed. To change this use the following routine:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mplay_data_mode(guar)</b></tt> 
    sets whether or not to use guaranteed transmission for 
	shared data. guar should either be true (the default) or false.<br>
</blockquote>
