<h1>Upgrading to the Pro Edition</h1>

<i>Game Maker</i> comes in two editions, the Lite Edition and the Pro Edition.

<p>
The <b>Lite Edition</b> is meant for those that take their first steps on the
path of developing games. It can be used for free but is limited in its
functionality. Also it shows a popup logo when running games and will regularly
remind you of upgrading the program. When you are using <i>Game Maker</i> regularly
you are strongly recommended to upgrade it to the Pro Edition.

<p>
The <b>Pro Edition</b> contains considerably more functionality and does not display any
logos or popup messages. More precisely, the Pro Edition has the following
additional functionality:

<ul>
  <li>No <i>Game Maker</i> logo is shown when running a game.</li>
  <li>No regular popups remind you of upgrading.</li>
  <li>You can use rotated, color blended and translucent sprites.</li>
  <li>There are additional options in the sprite and image editors.</li>
  <li>There are additional actions for e.g. CD music, rotated text, and colorized shapes.</li>
  <li>You can use special sound effects and positional sound.</li>
  <li>You can create splash screens with movies, images, webpages, texts, etc.</li>
  <li>There is a particle system to create explosions, fireworks, flames, rain, and other effects.</li>
  <li>A number of advanced drawing functions are available, for example colorized text and textured polygons.</li>
  <li>It is possible to create 3D games using functions for 3D graphics.</li>
  <li>It is possible to create multiplayer games that can be played over a network.</li>
  <li>You can define your own room transitions.</li>
  <li>You can use functions to create, load, and modify resources (sprites, backgrounds, etc.) 
      while the game is running.</li>
  <li>There is a collection of functions to create and use data structures.</li>
  <li>There are functions for motion planning.</li>
  <li>You get the possibility to include additional files in the game executables 
      that can be used when the game is run.</li>
  <li>The Pro Edition can easily be extended using extension package. These can be made by
      everybody and will in general be provided free of charge.</li>
  <li>Three such extension packages are included adding many room transitions, windows 
      dialogs, and printing facilities.</li>
  <li>You can define your own trigger events.</li>
  <li>You can export and import resources, which makes it easier to collaborate on games.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<p>

(subject to change). This is a one-time fee that will at least be valid
for all versions 8.x of <i>Game Maker</i>.
