<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</b></i>

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> is a program meant for making 2-dimensional and isometric games. Still
there is some functionality to create 3-dimensional graphics. Before you start with this though 
there are a few things you must understand.

<ul>
  <li> The 3D functionality in <i>Game Maker</i> is limited to the graphics part. There is
    no support for other 3D functionality. Once you start using 3D graphics you might
	get problems with other aspects of <i>Game Maker</i>, like the views,
	depth ordering, etc. The functionality is limited and has low priority to
	be extended. So don't expect support for 3D object models, etc.</li>
  <li> When you use the 3D functionality, there are a number of other things that can no
    longer be used. 
	<ul>
	  <li> You cannot use background and foregrounds in your rooms
	    anymore. (The reason is that they are tiled to fill the image but with perspective
	    projections this no longer work correctly).</li>
	  <li> You cannot use the mouse position anymore. The mouse will not be transformed to the 
	    3D coordinates. You can still get the position of the mouse on the screen (in the view)
		but you will have to do calculation with this yourself (or not use the mouse at all).</li>
	  <li> You cannot use tiles anymore. Tiles will most likely no longer match up correctly.</li>
	  <li> Collision checking still uses the 2-d positions of the instances in the room. So there
	    is no collision detection in 3D. Sometimes you can still use this (if you use the room
		as a representation of a flat world (e.g. for racing or FPS games) but in other situations
		you have to do things yourself.</li>
	</ul>
  <li> All 3D functionality is through code. You must be rather fluent with the GML language. 
    Also you must really understand a lot about how <i>Game Maker</i> works otherwise you will
	run into trouble.</li>
  <li> You must have some basic knowledge about 3D graphics. In particular I will use terms
    like perspective projections, hidden surface removal, lighting, and fog, without much
	explanation.</li>
  <li> There is no 3D modelling in <i>Game Maker</i>. Also I do not plan on adding support
    for loading 3D models.</li>
  <li> You must work carefully to keep a reasonable speed. Also, things are not really 
    optimized for speed. </li>
</ul>

<p>
If this did not discourage you, read on.
