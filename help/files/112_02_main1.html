<h3>Main actions, set 1</h3>

The following set of actions deals with creating, changing, and destroying instances of 
objects, with sounds, and with rooms.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_create.bmp"> Create Instance</b><br>
With this action you can create an instance of an object. You specify which 
object to create and the position for the new instance. If you check the <b>Relative</b> box, 
the position is relative to the position of the current instance. Creating 
instances during the game is extremely useful. A space ship can create bullets; 
a bomb can create an explosion, etc. In many games you will have some controller 
object that from time to time creates monsters or other objects. For the newly 
created instance the creation event is executed.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_createspeed.bmp"> Create Moving</b><br>
This action works the same as the action above but with two additional fields. 
You can now also specify the speed and direction of the newly created instance. 
Note that if you check the <B>Relative</B> box, only the position is relative, 
not the speed and direction. For example, to make a bullet move in the direction 
of the person shooting you have to use a little trick. As position use 
0,0 and check <B>Relative</B>. As direction we need the current direction 
of the instance. This can be obtained by typing in the word <tt>direction</tt>. 
(This actually is a variable that always indicates the current direction 
in which the instance is moving.)

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_createrandom.bmp"> Create Random</b><br>
This action lets you create an instance of one out of four objects. You specify
the four objects and the position. An instance of one of these four objects
is created at the given position. If you check the <b>Relative</b> box, 
the position is relative to the position of the current instance. If you need
a choice out of less than four objects you can use No Object for some of them.
This is for example useful to generate a random enemy at a location. 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_change.bmp"> Change Instance</b><br>
With this action you can change the current instance into an instance of 
another object. So for example, you can change an instance of a bomb into 
an explosion. All settings, such as the motion and the value of variables, 
will stay the same. You can indicate whether or not to perform the destroy 
event for the current object and the creation event for the new object.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_destroy.bmp"> Destroy Instance</b><br>
With this action you destroy the current instance. The destroy event 
for the instance is executed.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_killposition.bmp"> Destroy at Position</b><br>
With this action you destroy all instances whose bounding box contains a 
given position. This is useful, for example, when you use an exploding bomb. 
When you check the <b>Relative</b> box the position is taken relative to 
the position of the current instance.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_sprite.bmp"> Change Sprite</b><br>
Use this action to change the sprite for the instance. You indicate which new sprite. 
You can also indicate with subimage must be shown. Normally you would use 0 for
this (the first subimage) unless you want to see a particular subimage. Use -1 if
you do not want to change the current subimage shown. Finally
you change the speed of the animation of the subimages. If you only want to see
a particular subimage, set the speed to 0. If the speed is larger than one
subimages will be skipped. If it is smaller than 1 subimages will be shown
multiple times. Don't use a negative speed. Changing sprites is an important feature. 
For example, often you want to change the sprite of a character depending on 
the direction in which it walks. This can be achieved by making different sprites 
for each of the (four) directions. Within the keyboard events for the arrow keys 
you set the direction of motion and the sprite.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_spritetransform.bmp"> Transform Sprite</b><br>
Use this action to change the size and orientation of the sprite for the instance.
Use the scale factors to make it larger or smaller. The angle gives the counter-clockwise
orientation of the sprite. For example, to make the sprite oriented in the direction of
motion use as a value <tt>direction</tt>. For example, this is useful for a car. You can also
indicate whether the sprite should be mirrored horizontally and/or flipped vertically.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_spritecolor.bmp"> Color Sprite</b><br>
Normally the sprite is drawn as it is defined. Using this action you can change the
color of the sprite. This color is blended with the sprite, that is, it is combined
with the colors of the sprite. If you want to draw a sprite in different colors you
better define the sprite in black and white and use the blend color to set the
actual color. You can also indicate an alpha transparency. With a value of 1 the
sprite is opaque. With a value of 0 it is completely transparent. With a value in
between you will partially see the background shine through it. This is great for
making explosions.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_sound.bmp"> Play Sound</b><br>
With this action you play one of the sound resources you added to your game. 
You can select the sound you want to play and choose whether it should play only once 
(the default) or loop continuously. Multiple wave sounds can play at once but 
only one midi sound can play at a time. So if you start a midi sound, the current midi 
sound is stopped.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_soundend.bmp"> Stop Sound</b><br>
This action stops the indicated sound. If multiple instances of this sound 
are playing all are stopped.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_ifsound.bmp"> Check Sound</b><br>
If the indicated sound is playing the next action is performed. Otherwise 
it is skipped. You can select <b>Not</b> to indicate that the next action 
should be performed if the indicated sound is not playing. For example, 
you can check whether some background music is playing and, if not, start 
some new background music.
Note that this action returns true when the sound actually plays through the speakers. After you call the
action to play a sound it does not immediately reach the speakers so the action
might still return false for a while. Similar, when the sound is stopped you still hear
it for a while (e.g. because of echo) and the action will still return true.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_roomprevious.bmp"> Previous Room</b><br>
Move to the previous room. You can indicate the type of transition effect 
between the rooms. You should experiment to see what works best for you. When the rooms do
not have the same size you better do not use transitions. 
If you are in the first room you get an error.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_roomnext.bmp"> Next Room</b><br>
Move to the next room. You can indicate the transition.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_roomcurrent.bmp"> Restart Room</b><br>
The current room is restarted. You indicate the transition effect.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_roomother.bmp"> Different Room</b><br>
With this action you can go to a particular room. You indicate the room and the 
transition effect.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_ifroomprevious.bmp"> Check Previous</b><br>
This action tests whether the previous room exists. If so, the next action 
is executed. You normally need this test before moving to the previous room.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_ifroomnext.bmp"> Check Next</b><br>
This action tests whether the next room exists. If so, the next action 
is executed. You normally need this test before moving to the next room.
