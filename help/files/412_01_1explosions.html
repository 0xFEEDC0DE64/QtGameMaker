<h3>Simple Effects</h3>

The easiest way of creating particles is to use the effects mechanism.
Effects are created using the particle system but you do not have to worry
about all the details. You simply specify the type of effect, the position
where it must be created, its size, and its color. That is all. 

<p>
There are a number of different kinds of effects:

  <ul>
    <li><tt>ef_explosion</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_ring</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_ellipse</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_firework</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_smoke</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_smokeup</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_star</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_spark</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_flare</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_cloud</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_rain</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ef_snow</tt></li>
  </ul>

<p>
Some you want to create just once (like the explosion) and some you want to create in every step (like the
smoke or the rain). Note that rain and snow are always created at the top of the room so the position
is irrelevant in this case.

<p>
Even though this might sound limited, they can actually be used to create great effects. For example
by creating a smal puff of red smoke below a moving spaceship in each step, a tail of fire is created.
The following two functions exist to create the effects:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>effect_create_below(kind,x,y,size,color)</b></tt> 
    Creates an effect of the given kind (see above) at the
	indicated position. size give the size as follows: 0 = small,
	1 = medium, 2 = large. color indicates the color to
	be used. The effect is created below the instances, that is,
	at a depth of 100000.<br>
  <tt><b>effect_create_above(kind,x,y,size,color)</b></tt> 
    Similar to the previous function but this time the 
	effect is created on top of the instances, that is,
	at a depth of -100000.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you want to remove all effects, call the following function:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>effect_clear()</b></tt> 
    Clears all effects.<br>
</blockquote>
