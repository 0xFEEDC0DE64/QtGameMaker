<h3>Extra variables</h3>

You create new variables by assigning a value to them (no need to declare
them first). If you simply use a variable name, the variable will be
stored with the current object instance only. So don't expect to find it
when dealing with another object (or another instance of the same object)
later. You can also set and read variables in other objects by putting the
object name with a dot before the variable name.

<p>
To create global variables, that are visible to all object instances,
precede them with the word <tt>global</tt> and a dot. So for example you
can write:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  <b>if</b> (<b>global</b>.doit)
  {
    // do something
    <b>global</b>.doit = false;
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alternatively you can declare the variables as being global.
This declaration looks as follows.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>globalvar</b> &lt;varname1&gt;,&lt;varname2&gt;,&lt;varname3&gt;, ... ;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once this declaration has been executed, the variable is always treated as global without
the need to put the word <tt>global</tt> and a dot in front of it. It only needs to
be declared once in a piece of code that is executed. After that in all other
places the variable is considered as being global.

<p>
Sometimes you want variables only within the current piece of code or
script. In this way you avoid wasting memory and you are sure there is no
naming conflict. It is also faster than using global variables. To achieve
this you must declare the variables at the beginning of the piece of code
using the keyword var. This declaration looks as follows.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>var</b> &lt;varname1&gt;,&lt;varname2&gt;,&lt;varname3&gt;, ... ;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, you can write:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  <b>var</b> xx,yy;
  xx = x+10;
  yy = y+10;
  instance_create(xx,yy,ball);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
