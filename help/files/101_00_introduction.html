<h1>So you want to create your own computer games</h1>

<p>
Playing computer games is fun. But it is actually more fun to design your own computer 
games and let other people play them. In the past, creating computer games was not easy. 
Commercial computer games you buy nowadays typically take one or two years of 
development with teams of anywhere between 10 and 50 people. Budgets easily reach 
millions of dollars. And all these people are highly experienced: programmers, 
art designers, sound technicians, etc.
</p>

<p>
But <i>Game Maker</i> has changed this. With <i>Game Maker</i> you can
create your own computer games quickly without the need to learn a
programming language.
Of course you should not expect to create your 
own <i>Halo 4</i> or <i>Virtua Tennis</i> within a few weeks. But that is 
also not necessary. The joy of playing a game is not related to its complexity.
Simpler games, like <i>Tetris</i>, <i>Bejeweled</i>, 
<i>Space Invaders</i>, etc. are a lot of fun to play and a lot easier to create. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> offers an intuitive and easy to use drag-and-drop interface 
that allows you to create 
your own games very quickly. You can import and create images, sprites 
(animated images) and sounds and use them. <i>Game Maker</i> is bundled with
a considerable collection of such resources to get you started. 
You can easily define the objects 
in your game and indicate their behavior, and you can define appealing 
rooms (levels) in which the game takes place. And if 
you want full control there is actually an easy-to-use programming language 
built into <i>Game Maker</i> that gives you full control over what is happening in your game. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> focuses on two-dimensional games. So it is not
meant to create 3D worlds like <i>Quake</i>, even though there is some
limited functionality for 3D graphics.
But don’t let this put you down. Many great games use two-dimensional 
sprite technology, even though they look very 3-dimensional. And designing 
two-dimensional games is a lot easier and faster. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> comes in two editions, the Lite Edition and the Pro Edition.
The Lite Edition can be used free of charge but it is limited in its functionality
and will display popup messages. You can though freely distribute
the games you create with it; you can even sell them if you like. 
See the enclosed license agreement for more details. 
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade your copy of <i>Game Maker</i> to the Pro Edition. 
It will considerably extend the functionality of <i>Game Maker</i> 
and it will remove the logo when running games.
This will also support the further development of <i>Game Maker</i>. 
For more information on upgrading see the <A HREF="103_00_pro.html">Pro Edition</A> page.

<p>
This help file will tell you the most important things you need to know about <i>Game Maker</i> 
and how you can create your own games with it. Please realize that, 
even with a program like <i>Game Maker</i>, designing computer games 
is not completely effortless. There are too many aspects that are important: 
game play, graphics, sounds, user interaction, etc. Start with easy 
examples and you will realize that creating games is great fun.
