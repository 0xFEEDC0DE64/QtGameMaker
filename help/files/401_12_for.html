<h3>For statement</h3>

A for statement has the form

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>for</b> (&lt;statement1&gt; ; &lt;expression&gt; ;&lt;statement2&gt;) &lt;statement3&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This works as follows. First statement1 is executed. Then the expression
is evaluated. If it is true, statement 3 is executed; then statement 2 and
then the expression is evaluated again. This continues until the
expression is false.

<p>
This may sound complicated. You should interpret this as follows. The
first statement initializes the for-loop. The expression tests whether the
loop should be ended. Statement2 is the step statement that goes to the
next loop evaluation.

<p>
The most common use is to have a counter run through some range.

<p>
<b>Example</b><br>
The following program initializes an array of length 10 with the values 1-
10.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  <b>for</b> (i=0; i&lt;=9; i+=1) list[i] = i+1;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
