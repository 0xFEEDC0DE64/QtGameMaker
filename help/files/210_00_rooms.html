<h1>More about rooms</h1>

Rooms in <i>Game Maker</i> have many options. Before we only treated the
most important ones. In this chapter we will discuss the other options. When
you open the room form in advanced mode it looks as follows:

As you will see, some new buttons have been added to the toolbar. There are
buttons to sort the instances horizontally or vertically. This is useful
when instance partially overlap. (When adding tiles these buttons and the
others work on the tiles rather than the instances.) Also there are buttons
to lock all instances or unlock all instances. Locked instances cannot be
moved or deleted. This protects you against incidentally removing instances. 
(However, when using the toolbar buttons to delete or shift
all instances, also the locked ones are deleted or shifted.)
Using the right mouse button menu (hold &lt;Ctrl&gt; and right click on an
instance) you can also lock or unlock individual instances. 

<p>
Finally, you can indicate that you want to use an isometric grid. This is
very useful when creating isometric games. First of all, the grid lines now
run diagonally. Also the snapping of instances is different. (It works best
when the origin of the instance is at the top left corner as is default.)

<p>
Also there are two new tabs which we will discuss below.
