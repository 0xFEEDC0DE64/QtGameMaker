<h3>Scripts</h3>

Scripts cannot be changed during the execution of the game. The scripts are part of the 
game logic. Changing scripts would lead to self-rewriting code which very easily leads to 
errors. Also there are other ways to achieve this. If you really need to execute a piece 
of code that is not known at design time (e.g. from a file) you can use the following 
functions:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>execute_string(str,arg0,arg1,...)</b></tt> 
    Execute the piece of code in the string str with the indicated arguments.<br>
  <tt><b>execute_file(fname,arg0,arg1,...)</b></tt> 
    Execute the piece of code in the file with the indicated arguments.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>

Sometimes you want to store a script index in a variable and execute it. For this you can 
use the following function

<p>
<blockquote>
 <tt><b>script_execute(scr,arg0,arg1,...)</b></tt> 
 	Execute the script with index scr with the given arguments.<br.
</blockquote>
