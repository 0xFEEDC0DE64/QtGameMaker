<h3>Switch statement</h3>

In a number of situations you want to let your action depend on a
particular value. You can do this using a number of if statements but it
is easier to use the switch statement. A switch statement has the
following form:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>switch</b> (&lt;expression&gt;)
{
  <b>case</b> &lt;expression1&gt;: &lt;statement1&gt;; ... ; <b>break</b>;
  <b>case</b> &lt;expression2&gt;: &lt;statement2&gt;; ... ; <b>break</b>;
  ...
  <b>default</b>: &lt;statement&gt;; ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This works as follows. First the expression is executed. Next it is
compared with the results of the different expressions after the case
statements. The execution continues after the first case statement with
the correct value, until a break statement is encountered. If no case
statement has the right value, execution is continued after the default
statement. (It is not required to have a default statement.) 
Note that multiple case
statements can be placed for the same statement. Also, the break is not
required. If there is no break statement the execution simply continues
with the code for the next case statement.

<p>
<b>Example</b><br>
The following program takes action based on a key that is pressed.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>switch</b> (keyboard_key)
{
  <b>case</b> vk_left:
  <b>case</b> vk_numpad4:
    x -= 4; <b>break</b>;
  <b>case</b> vk_right:
  <b>case</b> vk_numpad6:
    x += 4; <b>break</b>;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
