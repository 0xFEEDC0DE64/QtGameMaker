<h3>Sound effects</h3>

<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</b></i>

<p>
Sound effects can be used to change the way sounds and background music sounds. Realize that
sound effects only apply to wave files and midi files, not to mp3 files. This section describes
the functions that exist for using and changing sound effects. Realize that to use these 
functions you need to have a good understanding of how sound and synthesizers work. No explanation
of the different parameters is given here. Search the web or books for further informations.


<p>
To apply a sound effect to a particular sound you can either indicate this when defining the
sound resource or you can use the following function

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>sound_effect_set(snd,effect)</b></tt> 
    Sets a (combination of) sound effect(s) for the indicated sound. <tt>effect</tt> can
	be any of the following values: 
	<blockquote>
      <tt><b>se_none</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_chorus</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_echo</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_flanger</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_gargle</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_reverb</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_compressor</b></tt><br> 
      <tt><b>se_equalizer</b></tt><br> 
	</blockquote>
	You can set a combination of effects by adding up the values. So e.g. you can use 
<p>
<pre>
sound_effect_set(snd,se_echo+se_reverb);
</pre>
	<p>
	to get a combination of echo and reverb effects.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
All effects have some default settings. You can change these settings once an effect has been applied
to a sound. The order here is crucial. You first apply the effect to the sound and next set the
parameters for it. Once you reapply effects to the sound, the settings are gone and you have to
set them again. Note that all parameters must lie in a particular range, which is indicated
below. The following functions exist for changing effect parameters:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>sound_effect_chorus(snd,wetdry,depth,feedback,frequency,wave,delay,phase)</b></tt> 
    Sets the parameters for the chorus effect for the indicated sound. The following
	parameters can be set: 
		<blockquote>
		<tt>wetdry</tt> Ratio of wet (processed) signal to dry (unprocessed) signal. 
		  (range: 0 to 100, default 50)<br>
		<tt>depth</tt> Percentage by which the delay time is modulated by the low-frequency oscillator, 
		  in hundredths of a percentage point. (range: 0 to 100, default 25)<br>
		<tt>feedback</tt> Percentage of output signal to feed back into the effect's input.
		  (range: -99 to 99, default 0)<br>
		<tt>frequency</tt> Frequency of the LFO. (range: 0 to 10, default 0)<br>

		</blockquote> 
  <tt><b>sound_effect_echo(snd,wetdry,feedback,leftdelay,rightdelay,pandelay)</b></tt> 
    Sets the parameters for the echo effect for the indicated sound. The following
	parameters can be set:
