<h1>Data structures</h1>

<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</b></i>

<p>
In games you often need to store information. For example you need to store 
lists of items that a person carries or you want to store places that still 
need to be visited. You can use the arrays for this. But if you want to do more 
complicated operations, like sorting the data or searching for a particular item, 
you need to write large pieces of GML code which can be slow to execute.

<p>
To remedy this, <i>Game Maker</i> has a number of built-in data 
structures that can be accessed through functions. At the moment 
there are six different types of data structure available: stacks, 
queues, lists, maps, priority queues, and grids. Each of these data structures 
is tuned for a particular type of use (see below).

<p>
All data structures work globally in the same way. You can create a data 
structure with a function that returns an id for the structures. You use 
this id to perform operations on the data structures. Once you are done 
you destroy the data structure again to save storage. You can use as many 
of the structures at the same moment as you want. All structure can store 
both strings and real values.

<p>
Please note that data structures and their content are not saved when you
save the game using the actions or functions for that. If you use data
structures and want to allow for saves you have to create your own mechanism
for that.

<p>
When comparing values, for example when searching in a map or sorting a list, 
<i>Game Maker</i> must decide when two values are equal. For strings and integer 
values this is clear but for real numbers, due to round-off errors, equal number 
can easily become unequal. For example (5/3)*3 will not be equal to 5. To avoid 
this, a precision is used. When the difference between two numbers is smaller 
than this precision they are considered equal. Default a precision of 0.0000001 
is used. You can change this precision using the following function:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>ds_set_precision(prec)</b></tt> 
    Sets the precision used for comparisons.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
This precision is used in all data structures but not in other comparisons in GML!
