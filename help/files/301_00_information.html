<h1>Game information</h1>

A good game provides the player with some information on how to play the game. 
This information is displayed when the player presses the &lt;F1&gt; key during 
game play. <i>Game Maker</i> has a simple built-in mechanism to provide game
help. However, it is limited in functionality. To create nicer games it is better
to create the help yourself using special rooms or by using splash screen with
e.g. html pages.

<p>
To create the simple game information, double click <b>Game Information</b> 
in the resource tree at the left of the screen. A little built-in editor is 
opened where you can edit the game information. You can use different fonts, 
different colors, and styles. Also you can set the background color.

<p>
In the <b>File</b> menu you can also set a number of <b>Options</b>. 
Default the help is shown in the game window and game play is temporarily
halted. Here you can indicate to show the help file in a separate window.
In this case you can indicate the caption of the game information during the game. Also
you can indicate the position (use -1 for centered) and size of the game
information window and whether it should have a border and be sizeable by 
the player. You can force the information window to stay on top and you
can indicate whether the game should continue playing while the information
is shown. 

<p>
Good advice is to make the information short but precise. Of course 
you should add your name because you created the game. All example games 
provided have an information file about the game and how it was created.
You might want to indicate at the 
bottom of the help file that the user must press Escape to continue playing.)

<p>
If you want to make a bit more fancy help, use a program like Word. Then select 
the part you want and use copy and paste to move it from Word to 
the game information editor. For more advanced games though you 
probably will not use this mechanism at all but use some dedicated rooms
to show help about the game.
