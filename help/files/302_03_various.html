<h3>Various other options</h3>

Here you can set a number of additional options. First of all you can set some default keys:

<p>
<b>Let &lt;Esc&gt; end the game</b><br>
When checked, pressing the escape key will end the game. More advanced games 
normally don't want this to happen because they might want to do some processing 
(like saving) before ending the game. In this case, uncheck this box and provide 
your own actions for the escape key. 

<p>
<b>Treat the close button as &lt;Esc&gt; key</b><br>
When checked the close button of the window will generate an escape key event. When
not checked the close button events are called instead.

<p>
<b>Let &lt;F1&gt; show the game information</b><br>
When checked pressing the F1 key will display the game information.

<p>
<b>Let &lt;F4&gt; switch between screen modes</b><br>
When checked the F4 key will switch between fullscreen and windowed mode.

<p>
<b>Let &lt;F5&gt; save the game and &lt;F6&gt; load a game</b><br>
When checked the player can use &lt;F5&gt; to store the current game situation
and &lt;F6&gt; to load the last saved game. (Note that only the basic game
data is stored. Once you use advanced features like particles or data structures
those settings are not saved and you might have to create a save mechanism yourself.

<p>
<b>Let &lt;F9&gt; take a screenshot of a game</b><br>
When checked the player can use &lt;F9&gt; to create a screenshot of the game.
This screenshot will be place in the file screenshotXXX.png in the folder where
the game is running, where XXX is the number of the screenshot. When creating
multiple screenshot the number is automatically increased.

<p>
Also you can set the priority of the game process. This priority indicates how 
much processor time is allotted to the game. In normal mode the operating system 
tries to give processor time to each process that needs it in some reasonable way. 
The higher you put the priority the more time is allotted to the game, making it 
run more smoothly and faster. But other processes get less time (also Windows 
processes so even the mouse might not move anymore). Use this with care.

<p>
Finally, you can set the version information of the game. This information is shown in the
helptip that pops up when the user rests his mouse on the game executable. It is also
shown when the users clicks with the right mouse button on the program and chooses 
properties and then version. If you distribute your game you best fill in this 
information. 

<p>
You should give your game a version number that consists of four parts: the major version,
the minor version, the release number and the build number. Also you should provide the
name of the company (you), the name of the product, the copyright information, and a
very brief description. All these fields should be at most 64 characters long.
