<h3>Collision checking</h3>

When planning motions or deciding on certain actions, it is often important 
to see whether there are collisions with other objects at certain places. The 
following routines can be used for this. All these have three arguments in 
common: The argument <TT>obj</TT> can be an object, the keyword <TT><B>all</b></tt>,
or the id of an instance. The argument <TT>prec</TT> indicates whether 
 the check should be precise or only based on the bounding box of the instance. 
 Precise checking is only done when the sprite for the instance has the 
 precise collision checking set. The argument <TT>notme</TT> can be set 
 to true to indicate that the calling instance should not be checked. 
 All these functions return either the id of one of the instances that 
 collide, or they return a negative value when there is no collision.

<blockquote>
  <tt><b>collision_point(x,y,obj,prec,notme)</b></tt>
    This function tests whether at point (x,y) there is a collision 
	with entities of object obj. <br>
  <tt><b>collision_rectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,obj,prec,notme)</b></tt>
    This function tests whether there is a collision between the (filled) 
	rectangle with the indicated opposite corners and entities of object obj.
	For example, you can use this to test whether an area is free of obstacles.<br>
  <tt><b>collision_circle(xc,yc,radius,obj,prec,notme)</b></tt>
    This function tests whether there is a collision between the (filled) 
	circle centered at position (xc,yc) with the given radius and entities 
	of object obj. For example, you can use this to test whether there is 
	an object close to a particular location.<br>
  <tt><b>collision_ellipse(x1,y1,x2,y2,obj,prec,notme)</b></tt>
    This function tests whether there is a collision between the (filled) 
	ellipse with the indicated opposite corners and entities of object obj. <br>
  <tt><b>collision_line(x1,y1,x2,y2,obj,prec,notme)</b></tt>
    This function tests whether there is a collision between the line segment 
	from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) and entities of object obj. This is a powerful 
	function. You can e.g. use it to test whether an instance can see another 
	instance by checking whether the line segment between them intersects a wall.<br>
