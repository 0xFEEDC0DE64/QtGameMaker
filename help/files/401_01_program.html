<h3>A program</h3>

A program consists of a set of instructions, called statements.  A program
must start with the symbol '{' and end with the symbol '}'. Between these
symbols there are the statements. Statements must be separated with a ';'
symbol. So the global structure of every program is:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  &lt;statement&gt;;
  &lt;statement&gt;;
  ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are a number of different types of statements, which will be
discussed below.
