<h1>Defining objects</h1>

With the resources you have seen so far you can add some nice images and
sounds to the game, but they don't do anything. We now come to the most
important resource of <i>Game Maker</i>, the objects. Objects are
entities in the game that do things. Most of the time they have a sprite
as a graphical representation so that you see them. They have behavior
because they can react to certain events. All things you see in the game
(except for the background) are objects. (Or to be more precise, they are
instances of objects.) The characters, the monsters, the balls, the
walls, etc. are all objects. There might also be certain objects that you
don't see but which control certain aspects of the game play.

<p>
Please realize the difference between sprites and objects. Sprites are
just (animated) images that don't have any behavior. Objects normally
have a sprite to represent them but objects have behavior. Without
objects there is no game!

<p>
Also realize the difference between objects and instances. An object
describes a certain entity, e.g. a monster. There can be multiple
instances of this object in the game. When we talk about an instance we
mean one particular instance of the object. When we talk about an object
we mean all the instances of this object.

<p>
To create an object in your game, choose <b>Create Object</b> from the <b>Resources</b> 
menu. The following form will appear:

<p>
<img src="images/form_object.jpg">

<p>
This is rather complex. At the left there is some general information
about the object. In the middle there is the list of events that can
happen to the object. At the right there are the different actions the
object can perform. Events and actions will be discussed in the coming
chapters.

<p>
As always, you can (and should) give your object a name. Next you can
choose the sprite for the object. To this end, click with the left
mouse button on the sprite box or the menu button next to it. A menu will
pop-up with all the available sprites. Select the one you want to use for
the object. 
If you do not have a sprite yet, you can click the button <B>New</B> to
create a new sprite resource and change it. Also, when you select a resource
there will be a button <B>Edit</B> here that you can use to change the
sprite. This is faster than first finding the resource in the list of
resources and then indicating you want to edit it.

<P>
Below this there are two check boxes. <b>Visible</b> indicates whether
instances of this object are visible. Clearly, most objects are visible,
but sometimes it is useful to have invisible objects. For example, you
can use them for waypoints for a moving monster. Invisible objects will
react to events and other instances do collide with them. The box labeled
<b>Solid</b> indicates whether this is a solid object (like a wall).
Collisions with solid objects are treated differently from collisions
with non-solid objects. You are strongly advised to use <b>Solid</b> only
for object that are not moving.
