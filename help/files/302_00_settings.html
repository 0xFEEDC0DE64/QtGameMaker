<h1>Global Game Settings</h1>

There are a number of settings you can change for your game. These change the shape
of the main window, set some graphics options, deal with interaction settings, to
loading image, constants and information about the creator of the game. Also you
can indicate here which files should be included in stand-alone games and how
errors should be handled.

<p>
The settings can be changed by double clicking on <b>Global Game Settings</b> 
in the resource tree at the left 
of the screen. They are subdivided in a number of tabbed pages. (Some options
are only available in advanced mode.)
