<h3>Splash screens</h3>


<b><i>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</i></b>

<p>
Many games have so-called splash screens. These screens show a video, an image, 
or some text. Often they are used at the beginning of the game (as an intro), 
the beginning of a level, or at the end of the game (for example the credits). 
In <i>Game Maker</i> such splash screens with text, images or video can be 
shown at any moment during the game. 

<p>
Default these splash screens are shown inside the game window, but it
is also possible to show them in a separate window. The game is interrupted
while the splash screen is shown. The player can return to the game by
pressing the escape key or by clicking with the mouse in the window. 
(These settings can be changed; see below.)

<p>
The following functions can be used to display the splash screens:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>splash_show_video(fname,loop)</b></tt>
    Shows a video splash screen. fname is the name of the video file.
	Whether a particular movie file is supported depends on the drivers
	on the machine. Typically you can use .avi, .mpg, and .wmv files but
	avoid special codecs. You best put this file in the folder of the game 
	yourself or in a subfolder. loop indicates whether to loop the video.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_show_text(fname,delay)</b></tt>
    Shows a text splash screen. fname is the name of the text file. You can
	either display standard text files (.txt) or rich text files (.rtf). Only
	part of the rich text features are taken into account. E.g. images and
	other embedded objects are not shown. 
	delay indicates the delay in milliseconds before returning 
	to the game. use 0 or a negative value to wait until the player presses the escape key
	or clicks with the mouse in the window. (Note that no scrollbar will be shown nor is
	there another way to scroll the text. So the text must fit the window.)<br>
  <tt><b>splash_show_image(fname,delay)</b></tt>
    Shows an image splash screen. fname is the name of the image 
	file. Many image types are supported (for example .bmp, .jpg, .tif, and .wmf) but
	no animated images. delay is the delay in milli seconds before returning 
	to the game.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_show_web(url,delay)</b></tt>
    Shows a web page splash screen. url is the url of the webpage (starting
	with <tt>http://</tt>) or it is the file name for a local html file. Note
	however that you must provide the full path for this to work. So you best
	e.g. use as url something like <tt>working_directory + "\index.html"</tt>. 
	delay is the delay in milli seconds before returning 
	to the game.<br>

You can change the way the splash screens are displayed using the functions below:
	
<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>splash_set_main(main)</b></tt>

	game window (true, default) or in a separate window (false).<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_scale(scale)</b></tt>
    Sets the scale factor to be used when displaying a splash video
	or image. When using a value of 0 the scale factor is chosen
	such that the window is filled (default).<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_cursor(vis)</b></tt>
    Sets whether the cursor should be visible in the splash screen.
	Default it is visible. For movies the cursor cannot be switched off.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_color(col)</b></tt>
    Sets the color of the area surrounding the image or video.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_caption(cap)</b></tt>

	is a separate splash window is used. Default the empty string is used.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_fullscreen(full)</b></tt>

	is a separate splash window is used. Default a normal window is used.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_border(border)</b></tt>

	is a separate normal splash window is used. Default a border is used.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_size(w,h)</b></tt>
    Sets the size of the splash window. This only has effect when
	is a separate normal splash window is used. Default size is 640x480.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_position(x,y)</b></tt>
    Sets the position of the splash window. This only has effect when
	is a separate normal splash window is used. Default Windows determines the position.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_adapt(adapt)</b></tt>
    Indicated whether the size of the window must be adapted to the scaled
	size of the video or image. This only has effect when
	is a separate splash window is used. Default adapt is true.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_top(top)</b></tt>
    Indicates whether the window should stay on top of other windows. This only has effect when
	is a separate splash window is used. Default the value is true.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_interrupt(interrupt)</b></tt>
    Indicates whether the game play should be interrupted while showing the
	splash window. This only has effect when
	is a separate splash window is used. Default the value is true.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_stop_key(stop)</b></tt>
    Indicates whether to stop the display of the splash screen when the player pressed
	the Escape key. Default the value is true.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_stop_mouse(stop)</b></tt>

	the mouse inside the splash screen. Default the value is true.<br>
  <tt><b>splash_set_close_button(show)</b></tt>

	This is useful when running games in full screen mode or without a border.
	Default the value is true.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is one particular type of splash info, which is the game information that the
user can enter in <i>Game Maker</i>. You can display it using the following function. 
You can also load a separate info file. This is closely related to the displaying of
the text splash screen but the display is governed by the settings provided when defining
the game information and not by the settings above. It is also displayed in a different
window, so it is possible to display both the game information and a splash screen at the same
moment. These functions also work in the Lite Edition.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>show_info()</b></tt>
    Displays the game information window.<br>
  <tt><b>load_info(fname)</b></tt> 
    Loads the game information from the file named fname. This should be a rich
	text file (.rtf). This makes it possible to show different help files at different moments. 
	Note that contrary to the spash screens, this rtf file cannot contain images.
