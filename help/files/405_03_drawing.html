<h3>Drawing sprites and backgrounds</h3>

Objects normally have a sprite associated to it that is drawn. But you can use 
the draw event to draw other things. This section and the next couple give you 
information on what is possible. First of all, there are functions to draw 
sprites and backgrounds in different ways. These give you more control over 
the appearance of the sprite. Also you can draw (parts of) backgrounds.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite(sprite,subimg,x,y)</b></tt> 
  	Draws subimage subimg (-1 = current) of 
	the sprite with its origin at position (x,y).
	(Without color blending and no alpha transparency.)<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_stretched(sprite,subimg,x,y,w,h)</b></tt>
    Draws the sprite stretched so that it fills the region with top-left 
	corner (x,y) and width w and height h.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_tiled(sprite,subimg,x,y)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the sprite tiled so that it fills the entire room. 
	(x,y) is the place where one of the sprites is drawn.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_part(sprite,subimg,left,top,width,height,x,y)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the indicated part of subimage subimg (-1 = current) of the sprite 
	with the top-left corner of the part at position (x,y).<br>
  <br>
  <tt><b>draw_background(back,x,y)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the background at position (x,y).
	(Without color blending and no alpha transparency.)<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_stretched(back,x,y,w,h)</b></tt>
  	Draws the background stretched to the indicated region.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_tiled(back,x,y)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the background tiled so that it fills the entire room.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_part(back,left,top,width,height,x,y)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the indicated part of the background with the top-left corner of the part at position (x,y).<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following functions are extended functions of the ones indicated above. 
<b><i>These extended versions can only be used in the Pro Edition!</i></b>

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_ext(sprite,subimg,x,y,xscale,yscale,rot,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
    Draws the sprite scaled with factors xscale and yscale and 
	rotated counterclockwise over rot degrees. color is the blending 
	color (use c_white for no blending) and alpha indicates the transparency 
	factor with which the images is merged with its background. A value 
	of 0 makes the sprite completely transparent. A value of 1 makes it 
	completely solid. This function can create great effect 
	(for example partially transparent explosions).<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_stretched_ext(sprite,subimg,x,y,w,h,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the sprite stretched so that it fills the region with 
	top-left corner (x,y) and width w and height h. color is the blending 
	color and alpha indicates the transparency setting.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_tiled_ext(sprite,subimg,x,y,xscale,yscale,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the sprite tiled so that it fills the entire room but now with scale factors and a 
	color and transparency setting.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_part_ext(sprite,subimg,left,top,width,height,x,y,xscale,yscale,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the indicated part of subimage subimg (-1 = current) of the sprite with 
	the top-left corner of the part at position (x,y) but now with scale factors and a color and transparency setting.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_sprite_general(sprite,subimg,left,top,width,height,x,y,xscale,yscale,rot,c1,c2,c3,c4,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	The most general drawing function. It draws the indicated part of subimage subimg (-1 = current) 
	of the sprite with the top-left corner of the part at position (x,y) but now with scale factors, a rotation angle,
	a color for each of the four vertices (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left),
	and an alpha transparency value. Note that rotation takes place around the top-left corner of the part.<br>
  <br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_ext(back,x,y,xscale,yscale,rot,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the background scaled and rotated with blending color (use c_white for no blending)
	and transparency alpha (0-1).<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_stretched_ext(back,x,y,w,h,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the background stretched to the indicated region. color is 
	the blending color and alpha indicates the transparency setting.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_tiled_ext(back,x,y,xscale,yscale,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the background tiled so that it fills the entire room but now 
	with scale factors and a color and transparency setting.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_part_ext(back,left,top,width,height,x,y,xscale,yscale,color,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	Draws the indicated part of the background with the top-left corner of the part at position (x,y) but now 
	with scale factors and a color and transparency setting.<br>
  <tt><b>draw_background_general(back,left,top,width,height,x,y,xscale,yscale,rot,c1,c2,c3,c4,alpha)</b></tt> 
  	The most general drawing function. It draws the indicated part 
	of the background with the top-left corner of the part at position (x,y) but now with scale factors, a rotation angle,
	a color for each of the four vertices (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left),
	and an alpha transparency value. Note that rotation takes place around the top-left corner of the part.<br>
