<h3>While statement</h3>

A while statement has the form

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>while</b> (&lt;expression&gt;) &lt;statement&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
As long as the expression is true, the statement (which can also be a
block) is executed. Be careful with your while loops. You can easily make
them loop forever, in which case your game will hang and not react to any
user input anymore.

<p>
<b>Example</b><br>

The following program tries to place the current object at a free position
(this is about the same as the action to move an object to a random
position).

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  <b>while</b> (!place_free(x,y))
  {
    x = random(room_width);
    y = random(room_height);
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
