<h3>Final words</h3>

The 3D functions in <i>Game Maker</i> can be used to make some nice 3D games. 
However, they are limited in functionality and still leave quite a lot of work to you.
Don't expect that you can make your own <i>Quake</i> with it. <i>Game Maker</i> is and remains primarily
a package for making 2-dimensional games.
