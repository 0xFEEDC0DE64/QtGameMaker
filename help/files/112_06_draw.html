<h3>Draw actions</h3>

Normally in each step of the game, for each instance, its sprite is drawn in the room.
You can change this by putting actions in the draw event. (Note that these are only
executed when the instance is visible!) The following drawing actions are available.
These actions only make sense in the drawing event. At other places they are 
basically ignored.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawsprite.bmp"> Draw Sprite</b><br>
You specify the sprite, the position (either absolute or relative 
to the current instance position) and the subimage of the sprite. 
(The subimages are numbered from 0 upwards.) If you want to 
draw the current subimage, use number -1.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawbackground.bmp"> Draw Background</b><br>
You indicate the background image, the position (absolute or relative) and 
whether the image should be tiled all over the room or not.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawtext.bmp"> Draw Text</b><br>
You specify the text and the position. A # symbol in the text is interpreted 
as going to a new line. (Use \# to get the # symbol itself.) So you can 
create multi-line texts. If the text starts with a quote or a double quote, 
it is interpreted as an expression. For example, you can use

<pre>
'X: ' + string(x)
</pre>

<p>
to display the value of the x-coordinate of the instance. 
(The variable x stores the current x-coordinate. The function <tt>string()</tt> turns 
this number into a string. + concatenates the two strings.)

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawtextext.bmp"> Draw Scaled Text</b><br>
This action is similar to the previous action but this time you can also 
specify a horizontal and vertical scaling factor to change the size of the
text and you can specify an angle to rotate it. 
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawrectangle.bmp"> Draw Rectangle</b><br>
You specify the coordinates of the two opposite corners of the rectangle; 
either absolute or relative to the current instance position.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawhorgradient.bmp"> Horizontal Gradient</b><br>
This action also draws a rectangle but this time using a gradient color that 
changes from left to right. You specify the rectangle and the two colors to use.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawvertgradient.bmp"> Vertical Gradient</b><br>
This action also draws a rectangle but this time using a gradient color that 
changes from top to bottom. You specify the rectangle and the two colors to use.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawellipse.bmp"> Draw Ellipse</b><br>
This action draws an ellipse.
You specify the coordinates of the two opposite corners of the surrounding 
rectangle; either absolute or relative to the current instance position.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawellipsegradient.bmp"> Gradient Ellipse</b><br>
Again an ellipse is drawn but this time you specify a color for the center and
the boundary.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawline.bmp"> Draw Line</b><br>
You specify the coordinates of the two endpoints of the line; either 
absolute or relative to the current instance position.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawarrow.bmp"> Draw Arrow</b><br>
Draws an arrow. You specify the coordinates of the two endpoints of the line
and the size of the arrow tip.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_color.bmp"> Set Color</b><br>
Lets you set the color used for drawing shapes, lines, and text.
(It does not influence the way sprites and backgrounds are drawn.)

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_fullscreen.bmp"> Set Full Screen</b><br>
With this action you can change the screen mode from windowed to fullscreen 
and back. You can indicate whether to toggle the mode or whether to go to 
windowed or fullscreen mode.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_snapshot.bmp"> Take Snapshot</b><br>
With this action you can take a snapshot image of the game and store 
it in a .png file. You specify the filename to store the image in.
<b><i>This action is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_explosion.bmp"> Create Effect</b><br>
With this action you can create all sorts of effects in a very simple way. You 
specify the type of effect, e.g. an explosion or smoke, its position, its size and its color and
whether it should be shown below the objects or on top of them. For the
rest it works automatic. (For rain and snow the position is irrelevant
as it always falls down from the top of the screen. To get continuous
rain you should create it in each step.) Please note that below actually means
at a depth of 100000 and above means at a depth of -100000.
