<p>
Playing games against the computer is fun. But playing games against other human players 
can be even more fun. It is also relatively easy to make such games because you don't have 
to implement complicated computer opponent AI. You can of course sit with two players 
behind the same monitor and use different keys or other input devices, but it is a lot 
more interesting when each player can sit behind his own computer. Or even better, 
one player sits on the other side of the ocean. <i>Game Maker</i> has multiplayer 
support. Please realize that creating effective multiplayer games that synchronize 
well and have no latency is a difficult task. This chapter gives a brief description 
of the possibilities. On the website a tutorial is available with more information.
