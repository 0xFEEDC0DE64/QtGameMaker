<h1>User interaction</h1>

There is no game without interaction with the user. 
The standard way of doing this in <i>Game Maker</i> is to put actions 
in mouse or keyboard events. But sometimes you need more control. 
From within a piece of code you can check whether certain keys on 
the keyboard are pressed and you can check for the position of the 
mouse and whether its buttons are pressed. Normally you check these 
aspects in the step event of some controller object and take 
action accordingly.
