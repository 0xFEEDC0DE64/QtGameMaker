<h3>Error options</h3>

Here you can set a number of options that relate to the way errors are reported.

<p>
<b>Display error messages</b><br>
When checked, error messages are shown to the player. In the final 
version of the game you might want to uncheck this option.

<p>
<b>Write error messages to file <tt>game_errors.log</tt></b><br>
When checked all error messages are written to a file called 
<tt>game_errors.log</tt> in the game folder.

<p>
<b>Abort on all error messages</b><br>
Normally, certain errors are fatal while others can be ignored. 
When checking this option all errors are considered fatal and lead 
to aborting the game. In the final version of the game you distribute 
you might want to check this option.

<p>
<b>Treat uninitialized variables as 0</b><br>
One common error is to use a variable before a value is assigned to it. 
Sometimes this is difficult to avoid. When checking this option such 
uninitialized variables no longer report an error but are treated as 
value 0. Be careful though. It might mean that you don't spot typing 
mistakes anymore.
