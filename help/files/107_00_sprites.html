<h1>Defining sprites</h1>

Sprites are the visual representations of all the objects in the game. A
sprite is either a single image, drawn with any drawing program you like,
or a set of images that, when played one after another, looks like an
animated motion. For example, the following four images form a sprite for
a character moving to the right.

<p>
<img src="images/sprite.jpg">

<p>
When you make a game you normally start by collecting a set of nice
sprites for the objects in your game. A considerable number of useful sprites is 
bundled with <i>Game Maker</i>. Other collections of interesting
sprites can be found on the <i>Game Maker</i> website. Many more
sprites can be found on the web, normally in the form of png or animated gif
files.

<p>
To create a sprite, choose the item <b>Create</b> Sprite from the <b>Resources</b>
menu, or use the corresponding button on the toolbar. The following form
will pop up.

<p>
<img src="images/form_sprite.jpg">

<p>
At the top-left you can indicate the name of the sprite. All sprites (and all
other resources) have a name. It's best to give each sprite a descriptive
name. Make sure all resources get different names. Even though this is
not strictly required, you are strongly advised to use only letters and
digits and the underscore symbol (_) in a name of a sprite (and any other
resource) and to let it start with a letter. In particular don't use the
space character. This will become important once you start using code.

<p>
To load a sprite, click on the button <b>Load Sprite</b>. A special file
dialog opens in which you can choose the sprite:

<p>
<img src="images/sprite_dialog.jpg">

<p>
The left part looks like the standard file selector in which you can select the 
sprite that you want. At the right you get a preview of the animated sprite and
some information about it. Here you can also indicate that you want to make the
sprite opaque (that is, remove any transparent parts), whether
to remove the background, making it transparent (default), and whether to smooth the
edges of the sprite, which can improve its appearance. When you are happy with
the result press <b>Open</b> to load the sprite. 
<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> can
load many different graphics files. When you load an animated gif, the
different subimages form the sprite images. 
When the file name ends with _stripXX, with XX a number, it 
is considered to contain a strip of XX subimages next to each other (not for
gif files). For example, a image file with name ball_strip4.png is assumed to
contain 4 subimages.

<p>
Once the sprite is loaded
the first subimage is shown on the right. When there are multiple sub-
images, you can cycle through them using the arrow buttons.

<p>
With the button <b>Edit Sprite</b> you can edit the sprite, or even
create a completely new sprite. <i>Game Maker</i> has an extensive built-in sprite
and image editor. For more information see the sections on
<a href="202_01_editing.html">Editing your sprites</a> and on
<a href="202_03_individual.html">Editing individual subimages</a>.
