<h3>Score actions</h3>

In most games the player will have a certain score. Also many games give the player 
a number of lives. Finally, often the player has a certain health. The following 
actions make it easy to deal with the score, lives, and health of the player.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_score.bmp"> Set Score</b><br>
<i>Game Maker</i> has a built-in score mechanism. The score is normally 
displayed in the window caption. You can use this action to change the score. 
You simply provide the new value for the score. Often you want to add something 
to the score. In this case don't forget the check the <b>Relative</b> box.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_ifscore.bmp"> Test Score</b><br>
With this question action you can check whether the score has reached a particular 
value. You indicate the value and whether the score should be equal to that value, 
be smaller than the value or be larger than the value.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawscore.bmp"> Draw Score</b><br>
With this action you can draw the value of the score at a particular position on 
the screen. You provide the positions and the caption that must be placed in front 
of the score. The score is drawn in the current font. This action can only be used 
in the drawing event of an object.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_highscore.bmp"> Show Highscore</b><br>
For each game the top ten scores are maintained. This action displays the highscore 
list. If the current score is among the top ten, the new score is inserted and the 
player can type his or her name. 
You can indicate what background image to use, whether the window 
should have a border, what the color for the new entry and the other entries must be, 
and which font to use.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_highscoreclear.bmp"> Clear Highscore</b><br>
This action clears the highscore table.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_lives.bmp"> Set Lives</b><br>
<i>Game Maker</i> also has a built-in lives system. With this action you can 
change the number of lives left. Normally you set it to some value like 3 at 
the beginning of the game and then decrease or increase the number depending 
on what happens. Don't forget to check the <b>Relative</b> box if you want to 
add or subtract from the number of lives. At the moment the number of lives 
becomes 0 (or smaller than 0) a &quot;no more lives&quot; event is generated.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_iflives.bmp"> Test Lives</b><br>
With this question action you can check whether the number of lives has reached 
a particular value. You indicate the value and whether the number of lives should 
be equal to that value, be smaller than the value or be larger than the value.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawlives.bmp"> Draw Lives</b><br>
With this action you can draw the number of lives at a particular position on 
the screen. You provide the positions and the caption that must be placed in 
front of the number of lives. The number of lives is drawn in the current font. 
This action can only be used in the drawing event of an object.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawlivesimage.bmp"> Draw Life Images</b><br>
Rather than drawing the number of lives left as a number, it is often nicer to 
use a number of small images for this. This action does precisely that. You 
specify the position and the image and at the indicated position the number of 
lives is drawn as images. This action can only be used in the drawing event of an object.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_health.bmp"> Set Health</b><br>
<i>Game Maker</i> has a built-in health mechanism. You can use this action to 
change the health. A value of 100 is considered full health and 0 is no health 
at all. You simply provide the new value for the health. Often you want to 
subtract something from the health. In this case don't forget the check the 
<b>Relative</b> box. When the health becomes smaller or equal to 0 an out 
of health event is generated.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_ifhealth.bmp"> Test Health</b><br>
With this question action you can check whether the health has reached a 
particular value. You indicate the value and whether the health should be 
equal to that value, be smaller than the value or be larger than the value.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_drawhealth.bmp"> Draw Health</b><br>
With this action you can draw the health in the form of a health bar. When 
the health is 100 the full bar is drawn. When it is 0 the bar is empty. You 
indicate the position and size of the health bar and the color of the bar 
and the background.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_caption.bmp"> Score Caption</b><br>
Normally in the window caption the name of the room and the score is displayed. 
With this action you can change this. You can indicate whether or not to show 
the score, lives, and/or health and what the caption for each of these must be.
