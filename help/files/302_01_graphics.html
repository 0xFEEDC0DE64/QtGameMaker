<h3>Graphics options</h3>

In this tab you can set a number of options that are related to the graphical 
appearance of your game. It is normally useful to check out the effects of these 
options because they can have a significant effect on the way the game looks. 
Remember though that different users have different machines. So better make sure 
that the settings also work on other peoples machines.

<p>
<b>Start in fullscreen mode</b><br>
When checked the game runs in the full screen; otherwise it runs in a window.

<p>
<b>Scaling</b><br>
Here you can indicate what happens when the window is larger than the room
or when the game is run in full-screen mode. There are three choices. You can
indicate a fixed scaling. The room is drawn scaled with the given amount in the
center of the window or the center of the screen. 100 indicates no scaling. 
You typically use fixed scaling when your sprites and rooms are very small. The second
option is scale the room such that it fills the window or screen but keep 
the aspect ratio (ratio between width and height) the same. The third
option is to scale such that the window or screen is completely filled. This
can lead to distortions in the image (in particular in windowed mode when 
the user can resize the window).

<p>
<b>Interpolate colors between pixels</b><br>
When checked, colors of pixels in sprites, backgrounds, and tiles that are not 
aligned with pixels on the screen will be interpolated. This in particular is the
case when they are scaled, rotated, or placed at non-integer positions. Interpolation
makes movement smoother but can also give a blurred effect. (Also for tiles it can
lead to cracks between them, if not carefully designed.)

<p>
<b>Color outside the room region</b><br>
When the room does not completely fill the window or screen there is some area
unused around it. Here you can specify the color of the area.

<p>
<b>Allow the player to resize the game window</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the user can change the size of the game window by
dragging with the mouse at its corners.

<p>
<b>Let the game window always stay on top</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the game window always stays on top of other windows.

<p>
<b>Don't draw a border in windowed mode</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the game window will not have a border or a caption bar.

<p>
<b>Don't show the buttons in the window caption</b><br>
When checked in windowed mode the window caption will not show the buttons to 
close the window or to minimize or maximize it.

<p>
<b>Display the cursor</b><br>
Indicates whether you want the mouse pointer to be visible. Turning it off is
normally faster and nicer. 
(You can easily make you own cursor object in <i>Game Maker</i>.)

<p>
<b>Freeze the game when the form loses focus</b><br>
When checked, whenever the player brings some other form to the top (e.g. 
another application) the game freezes until the game window again gets the 
focus.

<p>
<b>Disable screensavers and power saving actions</b><br>
When checked (default) screensavers or power saving actions (sleep, hibernate) will not
activate while the game is running. This is important as these might destroy certain
graphics aspects of the game (like surfaces).
