<h3>Firework Example</h3>

Here is an example of a particle system that creates fireworks. 
The firework uses two particle types: one that forms the rocket 
and one that forms the actual fireworks. The rocket generates 
the firework particles when it dies. We also generate one 
emitter in the particle system that regularly stream out rocket 
particles along the bottom of the screen. To make this work you need an object. 
In its creation event we place the following code that creates 
the particle types, particle system, and the emitter:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  // make the particle system
  ps = part_system_create();

  // the firework particles
  pt1 = part_type_create();
  part_type_shape(pt1,pt_shape_flare);
  part_type_size(pt1,0.1,0.2,0,0);
  part_type_speed(pt1,0.5,4,0,0);
  part_type_direction(pt1,0,360,0,0);
  part_type_color1(pt1,c_red);
  part_type_alpha2(pt1,1,0.4);
  part_type_life(pt1,20,30);
  part_type_gravity(pt1,0.2,270);

  // the rocket
  pt2 = part_type_create();
  part_type_shape(pt2,pt_shape_sphere);
  part_type_size(pt2,0.2,0.2,0,0);
  part_type_speed(pt2,10,14,0,0);
  part_type_direction(pt2,80,100,0,0);
  part_type_color2(pt2,c_white,c_gray);
  part_type_life(pt2,30,60);
  part_type_gravity(pt2,0.2,270);
  part_type_death(pt2,150,pt1);    // create the firework on death

  // create the emitter
  em = part_emitter_create(ps);
  part_emitter_region(ps,em,100,540,480,490,ps_shape_rectangle,ps_distr_linear);
  part_emitter_stream(ps,em,pt2,-4);   // create one every four steps
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
That will do the trick. You might want to make sure the particle system (and maybe particle types) are
destroyed when moving to another room, otherwise the firework will continue forever.
