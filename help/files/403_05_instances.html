<h3>Instances</h3>

In the game, the basic units are the instances of the different objects. During 
game play you can change a number of aspects of these instances. Also you can 
create new instances and destroy instances. Besides the movement related 
variables discussed above and the drawing related variables discussed below, 
each instance has the following variables:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>object_index*</b></tt>
    Index of the object this is an instance of. This variable cannot be changed.<br>
  <tt><b>id*</b></tt>
    The unique identifier for the instance (&gt;= 100000). (Note that 
	when defining rooms the id of the instance under the mouse is always indicated.)<br>
  <tt><b>mask_index</b></tt>
    Index of the sprite used as mask for collisions. Give this a value 
	of -1 to make it the same as the sprite_index.<br>
  <tt><b>solid</b></tt>
    Whether the instance is solid. This can be changed during the game.<br>
  <tt><b>persistent</b></tt>
    Whether the instance is persistent and will reappear when moving 
	to another room. You often want to switch persistence off at certain 
	moments. (For example if you go back to the first room.)<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is one problem when dealing with instances. It is not so easy to identify 
individual instances. They don't have a name. When there is only one instance 
of a particular object you can use the object name but otherwise you need to 
get the id of the instance. This is a unique identifier for the instance. you 
can use it in <b>with</b> statements and as object identifier. Fortunately 
there are a number of variables and routines that help you locate instance id's.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>instance_count*</b></tt>
    Number of instances that currently exist in the room.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_id[0..n-1]*</b></tt>
    The id of the particular instance. Here n is the number of instance.
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the assignment of the instances to the instance id's changes every 
step so you cannot use values from previous steps. Also please note that instances
that are deleted will remain in the list until the end of the step. So if you
are also deleting instances you need to check whether the instance still exists.
Let me give an example. Assume each unit in your game has a particular power 
and you want to locate the strongest one, you could use the following code:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  maxid = -1;
  maxpower = 0;
  <b>for</b> (i=0; i&lt;instance_count; i+=1)
  {
    iii = instance_id[i];
    <b>if</b> (instance_exists(iii))
      <b>if</b> (iii.object_index == unit)
      {
        <b>if</b> (iii.power &gt; maxpower)
          {maxid = iii; maxpower = iii.power;}
      }
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
After the loop maxid will contain the id of the unit with largest power. Of course, for this particular
situation the following code would be better:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  maxid = -1;
  maxpower = 0;
  <b>with</b> (unit) <b>do</b>
  {
    <b>if</b> (power &gt; maxpower)
      {maxid = self; maxpower = power;}
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>instance_find(obj,n)</b></tt>
    Returns the id of the (n+1)'th instance of type obj. obj can be an object 
	or the keyword all. If it does not exist, the special object noone is 
	returned. Note that the assignment of the instances to the instance id's 
	changes every step so you cannot use values from previous steps.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_exists(obj)</b></tt>
    Returns whether an instance of type obj exists. obj can be an object, 
	an instance id, or the keyword all.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_number(obj)</b></tt>
    Returns the number of instances of type obj. obj can be an object or 
	the keyword all.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_position(x,y,obj)</b></tt>
  	 Returns the id of the instance of type obj at position (x,y). When 
	 multiple instances are at that position the first is returned. obj can 
	 be an object or the keyword all. If it does not exist, the special object 
	 noone is returned.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_nearest(x,y,obj)</b></tt>
    Returns the id of the instance of type obj nearest to (x,y). obj can be an 
	object or the keyword all.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_furthest(x,y,obj)</b></tt>
    Returns the id of the instance of type obj furthest away from (x,y). obj can 
	be an object or the keyword all.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_place(x,y,obj)</b></tt>
    Returns the id of the instance of type obj met when the current instance is 
	placed at position (x,y). obj can be an object or the keyword all. If it 
	does not exist, the special object noone is returned.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following functions can be used for creating and destroying instances.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>instance_create(x,y,obj)</b></tt>
    Creates an instance of obj at position (x,y). The function returns 
	the id of the new instance.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_copy(performevent)</b></tt>
    Creates a copy of the current instance. The argument indicates whether 
	the creation event must be executed for the copy. The function returns 
	the id of the new copy.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_destroy()</b></tt>
    Destroys the current instance.<br>
  <tt><b>instance_change(obj,perf)</b></tt>
    Changes the instance into obj. perf indicates whether to perform the 
	destroy and creation events.<br>
  <tt><b>position_destroy(x,y)</b></tt>
    Destroys all instances whose sprite contains position (x,y).<br>
  <tt><b>position_change(x,y,obj,perf)</b></tt>
    Changes all instances at (x,y) into obj. perf indicates whether to
	 perform the destroy and creation events.<br>
