<h1>Creating particles</h1>

<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</b></i>

<p>
Particle systems are meant to create special effects. Particles are small elements,
represented by a little sprite. 
Such particles move around according to predefined rules and can change 
size, orientation, color, etc. while they move. Many such particles together can create e.g. 
fireworks, flames, explosions, rain, snow, star fields, flying debris, etc.

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> contains an extensive particle system that can be used 
to create great effects.
Because of its generality it is not simple to use so better read 
this section carefully before trying. 

<p>
If this is too complicated for you, there is also a very simple mechanism
to create different types of explosions, smoke, rain, and even fireworks.

<p>
Particle systems have many parameters 
and it is not always easy to understand how to create the effects you want.
First of all there are particle types. A particle type defines a particular 
kind of particles. Such types have many parameters that describe the 
shape, size, color, and motion of the particles. Particle types need to
be defined only once and can then be used everywhere in the game.

<p>
Secondly there are particle systems. There can be different particle systems 
in the game. A particle system can have particles of the different types. 
A particle system has emitters that create the particles, either 
continuously or in bursts. It can also have attractors that attract particles. 
Finally, it can have destroyers that destroy particles. Once particles are
created in a particle system, they are automatically handled (updated and
drawn) by the system.
