<h3>Players</h3>

Each instance of the game that joins a session is a player. 
As indicated above, players have names. There are three routines 
that deal with players.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mplay_player_find()</b></tt> 
    searches for all players in the current session and returns 
	the number of players found.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_player_name(numb)</b></tt> 
    returns the name of player number numb (0 is the first player, 
	which is always yourself). This routine can only be called after 
	calling the previous routine.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_player_id(numb)</b></tt> 
    returns the unique id of player number numb (0 is the first player, 
	which is always yourself). This routine can only be called after 
	calling the first routine. This id is used in sending and receiving 
	messages to and from individual players.<br>
