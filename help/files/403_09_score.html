<h3>Score</h3>

Other important aspects of many games are the score, the health, and the number 
of lives. <i>Game Maker</i> keeps track of the <tt>score</tt> in a global 
variable <tt>score</tt> and the number of <tt>lives</tt> in a global variable 
lives. You can change the score by simply changing the value of this variable. 
The same applies to health and lives. If lives is larger than 0 and becomes 
smaller than or equal to 0 the no-more-lives event is performed for all 
instances. If you don't want to show the score and lives in the caption, 
set the variable <tt>show_score, etc.</tt>, to false. Also you can change 
the caption. For more complicated games best display the score yourself.
