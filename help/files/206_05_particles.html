<h3>Particle actions</h3>

A set of action dealing with particles is available on the <b>Extra</b> tab.
<b><i>These actions are only available in the Pro Edition of <i>Game Maker</i></i></b>.

<p>
Particle systems are meant to create special effects. Particles are small 
elements (represented by a pixel or a little shape). Such particles move 
around according to predefined rules and can change color while they move. 
Many such particles together can create e.g. fireworks, flames, rain, snow, 
star fields, flying debris, etc.

<p>
<i>Game Maker</i> contains an extensive particle system that can be accessed through 
functions. A more limited particle system can be accessed through the actions described below.

<p>
A particle system can deal with particles of different types. After creating 
the particle system the first thing to do is specify the particle types. Using 
the actions below you can specify up to 16 types of particles. Each type has a shape, 
a size, a start color and an end color. The color slowly changes from the start color 
to the end color. Particles have a limited life time. In the type you specify the 
minimal and maximal life time of the particles. Particles also have a speed and a 
direction. Finally, gravity and friction can work on particles.

<p>
After you specify the particle types you must create them at places in 
the room. You can either burst a number of particles of a particular type 
from a place or you can create a constant stream of particles appearing. 
Particles appear at emitters. The particle system can have up to 8 emitters 
working at the same time. So after you create the particle types you must 
create the emitters and tell them to burst or stream particles.

<p>
Here is the complete set of actions. Best experiment with them to get the required effect.


<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partsystcreate.bmp"> Create Part System</b><br>
This action creates the particle system. It must be called before any other actions 
can be used. You only need to call it once. You can specify the depth at which the 
particles are drawn. If you use a large positive depth the particles appear behind 
the instances. If you use a negative depth they appear in front of the instances.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partsystdestroy.bmp"> Destroy Part System</b><br>
This action destroys the particle system, freeing all its memory. Don't forget to 
call this (e.g. when you move to a different room) because particle systems use a lot of storage.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partsystclear.bmp"> Clear Part System</b><br>
This action removes all the particles currently visible. It does not stop the emitters 
so new particles might be created again if you have streaming emitters (see below).

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_parttypecreate.bmp"> Create Particle</b><br>
With this action you create a particle type. You can choose one of the 16 types 
available. For the particle type you can specify its shape or the sprite to be 
used for it. If you specify a sprite the sprite will be used. If you set the sprite
to no sprite, the shape will be used. There are a number of interesting built-in
shapes. You also indicated its minimal and 
maximal size (when the particle appears a random value between these bounds is 
used). Finally you specify the increase in size in each step. For a decrease, use
a negative value. Note that only a particle type is created, not an actual particle. 
For this you need emitters (see below).

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_parttypecolor.bmp"> Particle Color</b><br>
A particle can have a color (default the color is white). With this action you can
set the color to be used for a particular type. You must indicate the particle type
the color is defined for. Next you specify how a color is applied. Either a random
color is choosen between two given colors, or the color starts with the first color
and than gradually over the lifetime of the particle, it changes to the second color.
Both colors must be given. Finally you can indicate the alpha transparency. You specify
the transparency at the moment the particle is created and when it dies. The transparency
slowly changes between these values. It is normally nice to decrease the alpha value over the
lifetime of a particle.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_parttypelife.bmp"> Particle Life</b><br>
A particle lives for a limited number of steps. After this is disappears. With this 
action you set the life time for a particle type. You give two limiting values and the actual 
life time is chosen randomly between them.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_parttypespeed.bmp"> Particle Speed</b><br>
With this action you can set the speed and direction of motion for a particle type. 
Again you give two limits and the actual value is chosen randomly between them. For 
example, to make the particle move in a random direction, give 0 and 360 for the 
limits for the direction. You can also specify a friction. This amount is subtracted 
from the speed in each step until it becomes 0. (You can make a particle speed up 
by using a negative friction.)

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_parttypegravity.bmp"> Particle Gravity</b><br>
With this action you set the amount of gravity and direction of gravity for a 
particular particle type. 270 is downwards.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_parttypesecondary.bmp"> Particle Secondary</b><br>
This is a bit more complicated. Particles can create other particles during their 
life time and when they die. With this action you can specify this. You can define 
the type and number of particles that must be created at each step during the life 
time and you can specify the type and number of particles that must be created when 
the particle dies. Be very careful here. You can easily create huge numbers of 
particles in this way, slowing down the system considerably. For the numbers you 
can also use a negative value. A negative value x means that in each step a 
particle is created with chance -1/x. So for example, if you want to generate a 
secondary particle about every 4 steps, use a value of -4. Secondary particles 
are great for creating effects like tails of particles or exploding particles.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partemitcreate.bmp"> Create Emitter</b><br>
This action creates a particle emitter. Particles are generated by emitters. 
You can have up to eight emitters. Choose the emitter and specify the shape of 
it and its size and position (in the form of a bounding box).

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partemitdestroy.bmp"> Destroy Emitter</b><br>
This action destroys the indicated emitter. Note that existing particles that 
came from this emitter are not removed.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partemitburst.bmp"> Burst from Emitter</b><br>
Even if you defined a particle type and an emitter there are still no particles. 
You still have to tell the emitter to generate the particles. With this action you 
tell a particular emitter to generate a given number of particles of a given type. 
All these particles are generated at once. For the number you can also use a negative 
value. A negative value x means that a particle is created with chance -1/x. So for 
example, if you want to generate a particle with a chance of 25 percent, use a value of -4.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_partemitstream.bmp"> Stream from Emitter</b><br>
With this action you tell a particular emitter to stream a given number of particles 
of a given type. In each step this number of particles is generated, leading to a 
continuous stream of particles. The emitter will continue streaming particles until 
you destroy it or tell it to stream 0 particles. For the number you can also use a 
negative value. A negative value x means that in each step a particle is created 
with chance -1/x. So for example, if you want to generate a particle about every 
4 steps, use a value of -4.
