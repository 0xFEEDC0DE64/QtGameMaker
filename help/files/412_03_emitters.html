<h3>Emitters</h3>

Emitters create particles. They can either create a continuous stream of 
particles or can burst out a number of particles when using the appropriate 
function. A particle system can have an arbitrary number of emitters.
An emitter has the following properties:

<ul>
  <li><tt><b>xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax</b></tt> 
    indicate the extend of the region in which the particles are generated.</li>
  <li><tt><b>shape</b></tt> 
    indicates the shape of the region. It can have the following values:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_rectangle</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_ellipse</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_diamond</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_line</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <li><tt><b>distribution</b></tt> 
    indicates the distribution used to generate the particles. It can have the following values:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>ps_distr_linear</tt> 
	  indicates a linear distribution, that is everywhere in the region the chance is equal</li>
    <li><tt>ps_distr_gaussian</tt> 
	  indicates a Gaussian distribution in which more particles are generated 
	  in the center than at the sides of the region</li>   
	<li><tt>ps_distr_invgaussian</tt> 
	  indicates an inverse Gaussian distribution in which more particles are generated 
	  at the sides of the region than in the center</li>
  </ul>
  <li><tt><b>particle type</b></tt> 
    indicates the type of particles being generated</li>
  <li><tt><b>number</b></tt> 
    indicates the number of particles generated in each step. 
	If smaller than 0, in each step a particle is generated with a chance -1/number. 
	So for example with a value of -5 a particle is generated on average once every 5 steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following functions are available to set the emitters and to let them 
create particles. Note that each of them gets the index of the particle system 
to which it belongs as a first argument.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_create(ps)</b></tt> 
    Creates a new emitter in the given particle system. It returns the 
	index of the emitter. This index must be used in all 
	calls below to set the properties of the emitter.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_destroy(ps,ind)</b></tt> 
    Destroys emitter ind in the particle system. Call this 
    if you don't need it anymore to save space.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_destroy_all(ps)</b></tt> 
    Destroys all emitters in the particle system that have been created.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_exists(ps,ind)</b></tt> 
    Returns whether the indicated emitter exists in the particle system.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_clear(ps,ind)</b></tt> 
    Clears the emitter ind to its default settings.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_region(ps,ind,xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,shape,distribution)</b></tt> 
    Sets the region and distribution for the emitter.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_burst(ps,ind,parttype,number)</b></tt> 
    Bursts once <tt>number</tt> particles of the indicated type from the emitter.<br>
  <tt><b>part_emitter_stream(ps,ind,parttype,number)</b></tt>
    From this moment on create <tt>number</tt> particles of the indicated type 
	from the emitter in every step. If you indicate a number smaller 
	than 0 in each step a particle is generated with a chance of -1/number. 
	So for example with a value of -5 a particle is generated on
	average once every 5 steps.<br>
