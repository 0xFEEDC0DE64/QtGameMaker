<h3>Destroyers</h3>

Destroyers destroy particles when they appear in their region.
 A particle system can have an arbitrary number of destroyers. 
 A destroyer has the following properties:
 
<ul>
  <li><tt><b>xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax</b></tt> 
    indicates the extent of the region in which the particles are destroyed.</li>
  <li><tt><b>shape</b></tt> 
    indicates the shape of the region. It can have the following values:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_rectangle</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_ellipse</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ps_shape_diamond</tt></li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
The following functions are available to set the properties of the destroyers. 
Note that each of them gets the index of the particle system to which it belongs 
as a first argument.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>part_destroyer_create(ps)</b></tt> 
    Creates a new destroyer in the given particle system. It returns the index of the destroyer. 
	This index must be used in all calls below to set the properties of the destroyer.<br>
  <tt><b>part_destroyer_destroy(ps,ind)</b></tt> 
    Destroys destroyer ind in the particle system. 
	Call this if you don't need it anymore to save space.<br>
  <tt><b>part_destroyer_destroy_all(ps)</b></tt> 
    Destroys all destroyers in the particle system that have been created.<br>
  <tt><b>part_destroyer_exists(ps,ind)</b></tt> 
    Returns whether the indicated destroyer exists in the particle system.<br>
  <tt><b>part_destroyer_clear(ps,ind)</b></tt> 
    Clears the destroyer ind to its default settings.<br>
  <tt><b>part_destroyer_region(ps,ind,xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,shape)</b></tt> 
    Sets the region for the destroyer.<br>
