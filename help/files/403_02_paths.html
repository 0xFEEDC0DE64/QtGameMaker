<h3>Paths</h3>

In <I>Game Maker</I> you can define paths and order instances to follow such paths. 
Although you can use actions for this, there are functions and variables that give 
you more flexibility:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>path_start(path,speed,endaction,absolute)</b></tt>
    Starts a path for the current instance. The <TT>path</TT> is the name of the path you
    want to start. The <TT>speed</TT> is the speed with which the path must be followed. 
	A negative speed means that the instance moves backwards along the path. The 
	<TT>endaction</TT> indicates what should happen when the end of the path 
	is reached. The following values can be used:
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  0 : stop the path<br>
	  1: continue from the start position (if the path is not closed we jump to the start position<br>
	  2: continue from the current position<br>
	  3: reverse the path, that is change the sign of the speed<br>
	</blockquote>
    The argument <TT>absolute</TT> should be true or false. When true the absolute 
	coordinates of the path are used. When false the path is relative to the current 
	position of the instance. To be more precise, if the speed is positive, the start 
	point of the path will be placed on the current position and the path is followed 
	from there. When the speed is negative the end point of the path will be placed 
	on the current position and the path is followed backwards from there.<br>
  <tt><b>path_end()</b></tt>
    Ends the following of a path for the current instance.<br>
  <tt><b>path_index*</b></tt>
    Index of the current path the instance follows. You cannot change this 
	directly but must use the function above.<br>
  <tt><b>path_position</b></tt>
    Position in the current path. 0 is the beginning of the path. 1 is the end of 
	the path. The value must lie between 0 and 1.<br>
  <tt><b>path_positionprevious</b></tt>
    Previous position in the current path. This can be used e.g. in collision events 
	to set the position on the path back to the previous position.<br>
  <tt><b>path_speed</b></tt>
    Speed (in pixels per step) with which the path must be followed. Use a 
	negative speed to move backwards.<br>
  <tt><b>path_orientation</b></tt>
    Orientation (counter-clockwise) into which the path is performed. 0 is 
	the normal orientation of the path.<br>
  <tt><b>path_scale</b></tt>
    Scale of the path. Increase to make the path larger. 1 is the default value.<br>
  <tt><b>path_endaction</b></tt>
    The action that must be performed at the end of the path. You 
	can use the values indicated above.<br>
