<h3>Views</h3>

Finally, there is a tab labeled <b>views</b>. This gives a mechanism for
drawing different parts of your room at different places on the screen.
There are many uses for views. First of all, in a number of games you want
to show only part of the room at any time. For example, in most platform
games, the view follows the main character. In two-player games you often
want a split-screen mode in which in one part of the screen you see one
player and in another part you see the other player. A third use is in games
in which part of the room should scroll (e.g. with the main character) while
another part is fixed (for example some status panel). This can all be
easily achieved in <i>Game Maker</i>.

<p>
When you click the tab labeled <b>views</b> the following information will
show:

<p>
<img src="images/form_room_views.jpg">

<p>
At the top there is a box labeled <b>Enable the use of Views</b>. You must
check this box to use views. Below this you see the list of at most eight
views you can define. Below the list you can give information for the views.
First of all you must indicate whether the view should be visible when the
room starts. Make sure at least one view is visible. Visible views are shown
in bold. 

<p>
A view is defined by a rectangular area in the room. This is the area that
must be shown in the view. You specify the position of the top-left corner and
the width and height of this area. Secondly, you must specify where this area is
shown in the window on the screen. This is called the (view)port. 
Again you specify the position of the top-left
corner and the size. If you have a single view the position is typically (0,0).
Note that the size of the port can be different from the size of the view. In this
case the view will be scaled to fit in the port. (In code it is
also possible to rotate a view.) The ports can overlap. In this
case the are drawn in the indicated order on top of each other. 

<p>
As indicated above, you often want the view to follow a certain object. This
object you can indicate at the bottom. If there are multiple instances of
this object, only the first one is followed by the view. (In code you can
also indicate that a particular instance must be followed.) Normally the
character should be able to walk around a bit without the view changing.
Only when the character gets close to the boundary of the view, should the
view change. You can specify the size of the border that must remain visible
around the object. Finally, you can restrict the speed with which the view
changes. This might mean that the character can walk off the screen, but it
gives a much smoother game play. Use -1 if you want the view to change
instantaneously.
