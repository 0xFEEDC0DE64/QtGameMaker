<h3>Easy drawing</h3>

Once 3D mode has been switched on you can use <i>Game Maker</i> as you are used to it (except
for the remarks made at the beginning). Only objects will appear in different sizes based on 
their depth setting. You can even use views. One additional function can be useful. If you 
draw a number of things in a piece of code you might want to change the depth value between
the primitives you draw. For this you use:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>d3d_set_depth(depth)</b></tt>
    Sets the depth used for drawing.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that at the moment a new instance is drawn the depth is again set to the depth of that
instance.
