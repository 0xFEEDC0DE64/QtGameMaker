<h3>Move actions</h3>

The first set of actions consists of those related to movement of objects. 
The following actions exist:

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_move1.bmp"> Move Fixed</b><br>
Use this action to start the instance moving in a particular direction. 
You can indicate the direction using the buttons with the arrows on it. 
Use the middle button to stop the motion. Also you need to specify 
the speed of the motion. This speed is given in pixels per step. 
Preferably don't use negative speeds. 
You can specify multiple directions. In this case a random choice is made. 
In this way you can let a monster start moving either left or right.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_move2.bmp"> Move Free</b><br>
This is the second way to specify a motion. Here you can indicate a precise direction. 
This is an angle between 0 and 360 degrees. 0 means to the right. 
The direction is counter-clockwise. So for example 90 indicates an 
upward direction. If you want an arbitrary direction, you can type 
<tt>random(360)</tt>. As you will see below the function <tt>random</tt> gives 
a random number smaller than the indicated value. As you might have noticed there 
is a checkbox labeled <b>Relative</b>. If you check this, the new motion is added 
to the previous one. For example, if the instance is moving upwards and you 
add some motion to the left, the new motion will be upwards to the left.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_movepoint.bmp"> Move Towards</b><br>
This action gives a third way to specify a motion. You indicate a position and 
a speed and the instance starts moving with the speed towards the position. 
(It won't stop at the position!) For example, if you want a bullet to fly 
towards the position of the spaceship you can use as position <tt>spaceship.x, spaceship.y</tt>. 
(You will learn more about the use of variables like these below.) 
If you check the <b>Relative</b> box, you specify the position relative 
to the current position of the instance. (The speed is not taken relatively!)

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_hspeed.bmp"> Speed Horizontal</b><br>
The speed of an instance consists of a horizontal part and a vertical part. 
With this action you can change the horizontal speed. A positive horizontal 
speed means a motion to the right. A negative one means a motion to the left. 
The vertical speed will remain the same. Use relative to increase the horizontal speed 
(or decrease it by providing a negative number).

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_vspeed.bmp"> Speed Vertical</b><br>
In a similar way, with this action you can change the vertical speed of the instance.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_gravity.bmp"> Set Gravity</b><br>
With this action you can create gravity for this particular object. 
You specify a direction (angle between 0 and 360 degrees) and a speed, 
and in each step this amount of speed in the given direction is added 
to the current motion of the object instance. Normally you need a very 
small speed increment (like 0.01). Typically you want a downward direction 
(270 degrees). If you check the <b>Relative</b> box you increase the 
gravity speed and direction. Note that, contrary to real life, 
different object can have different gravity directions.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_hreverse.bmp"> Reverse Horizontal</b><br>
With this action you reverse the horizontal motion of the instance. 
This can for example be used when the object collides with a vertical wall.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_vreverse.bmp"> Reverse Vertical</b><br>
With this action you reverse the vertical motion of the instance. 
This can for example be used when the object collides with a horizontal wall.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_friction.bmp"> Set Friction</b><br>
Friction slows down the instances when they move. You specify the amount 
of friction. In each step this amount is subtracted from the speed 
until the speed becomes 0. Normally you want a very small number here (like 0.01).

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_jumpposition.bmp"> Jump to Position</b><br>
Using this action you can place the instance in a particular position. 
You simply specify the x- and y-coordinate, and the instance is placed 
with its reference point on that position. If you check the <b>Relative</b> box, 
the position is relative to the current position of the instance. 
This action is often used to continuously move an instance. 
In each step we increment the position a bit.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_jumpstart.bmp"> Jump to Start</b><br>
This action places the instance back at the position where it was created.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_jumprandom.bmp"> Jump to Random</b><br>
This action moves the instance to a random position in the room. 
Only positions are chosen where the instance does not intersect any 
solid instance. You can specify the snapping used. If you specify 
positive values, the coordinates chosen with be integer multiples of 
the indicated values. This could for example be used to keep the instance 
aligned with the cells in your game (if any). You can specify a separate 
horizontal snapping and vertical snapping.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_grid.bmp"> Align to Grid</b><br>
With this action you can round the position of the instance to a grid. 
You can indicate both the horizontal and vertical snapping value (that is, 
the size of the cells of the grid). This can be very useful to make sure 
that instances stay on a grid.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_wrap.bmp"> Wrap Screen</b><br>
With this action you can let an instance wrap around, that is, when
it leaves on one side of the room it reappears at the other side. This
action is normally used in the <b>Outside</b> event. Note that the
instance must have a speed for wrapping to work, cause the direction
of wrapping is based on the direction of the motion. You can indicate
whether to wrap only horizontal, only vertical, or in both directions.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_contact.bmp"> Move to Contact</b><br>
With this action you can move the instance in a given direction until a 
contact position with an object is reached. If there already is a collision 
at the current position the instance is not moved. Otherwise, the instance 
is placed just before a collision occurs. You can specify the direction but 
also a maximal distance to move. For example, when the instance is falling 
you can move a maximal distance down until an object is encountered. You can 
also indicate whether to consider solid object only or all objects. You typically 
put this action in the collision event to make sure that the instance stops 
in contact with the other instance involved in the collision.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_bounce.bmp"> Bounce</b><br>
When you put this action in the collision event with some object, the instance 
bounces back from this object in a natural way. If you set the parameter precise 
to false, only horizontal and vertical walls are treated correctly. When you set 
precise to true also slanted (and even curved) walls are treated correctly. 
This is though slower. Also you can indicate whether to bounce only against solid 
objects or against all objects. Please realize that the bounce is not completely 
accurate because this depends on many properties. But in many situations the 
effect is good enough.
