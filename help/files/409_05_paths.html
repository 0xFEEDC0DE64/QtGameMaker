<h3>Paths</h3>

It is possible to create paths and to add points to paths. However, never change a path 
that is being used by an instance. This can lead to unexpected results. The following 
functions exist:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>path_set_kind(ind,val)</b></tt> 
	Sets the kind of connections of the path with the 
	given index (0=straight, 1=smooth).<br>
  <tt><b>path_set_closed(ind,closed)</b></tt> 
	Sets whether the path must be closed (true) or open (false).<br>
  <tt><b>path_set_precision(ind,prec)</b></tt> 
	Sets the precision with which the smooth 
	path is calculated (should lie between 1 and 8).<br>
  <tt><b>path_add()</b></tt> 
	Adds a new empty paths. The index of the path is returned.<br>
  <tt><b>path_delete(ind)</b></tt> 
	Deletes the path with the given index.<br>
  <tt><b>path_duplicate(ind)</b></tt> 
	Creates a duplicate copy of the path with the 
	given index. Returns the index of the copy.<br>
  <tt><b>path_assign(ind,path)</b></tt> 
	Assigns the indicated path to path ind. So this 
	makes a copy of the path. In this way you can easily set an existing path to a different, 
	e.g. new path. <br>
  <tt><b>path_append(ind,path)</b></tt> 
	Appends the indicated path to path ind. <br>
  <tt><b>path_add_point(ind,x,y,speed)</b></tt> 
	Adds a point to the path with the given 
	index, at position (x,y) and with the given speed factor. Remember that a factor of 100 
	corresponds to the actual speed. Lower values mean slowing down and higher mean speeding up.<br>
  <tt><b>path_insert_point(ind,n,x,y,speed)</b></tt> 
	Inserts a point in the path with 
	the given index before point n, at position (x,y) and with the given speed factor.<br>
  <tt><b>path_change_point(ind,n,x,y,speed)</b></tt> 
	Changes the point n in the path 
	with the given index to position (x,y) and the given speed factor.<br>
  <tt><b>path_delete_point(ind,n)</b></tt> 
	Deletes the point n in the path with the given index.<br>
  <tt><b>path_clear_points(ind)</b></tt> 
	Clears all the points in the path, turning it into an empty path.<br>
  <tt><b>path_reverse(ind)</b></tt> 
	Reverses the path.<br>
  <tt><b>path_mirror(ind)</b></tt> 	
	Mirrors the path horizontally (with respect to its center).<br>
  <tt><b>path_flip(ind)</b></tt> 
	Flips the path vertically (with respect to its center).<br>
  <tt><b>path_rotate(ind,angle)</b></tt> 
	Rotates the path counter clockwise over angle degrees (around its center).<br>
  <tt><b>path_scale(ind,xscale,yscale)</b></tt> 
	Scales the path with the given factors (from its center).<br>
  <tt><b>path_shift(ind,xshift,yshift)</b></tt> 
	Shifts the path over the given amount.<br>
