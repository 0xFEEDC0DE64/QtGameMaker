<h1>Extension Packages</h1>

<b><i>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</i></b>

<p>
Extension packages extend the possibilities of <i>Game Maker</i>. An 
extension package can add a set of actions to <i>Game Maker</i>
or it adds a number of additional functions and constants to the GML language
built into <i>Game Maker</i>. When extension packages are
available to you, help about these is placed in the <b>Help</b> menu.

<p>
When double clicking on the <b>Extension Packages</b> resource item the following form is shown:

<p>

<p>
In this form you can indicate which extension packages must be used
in the game. On the left there is the list of <b>Used</b> packages and on the 
right is the list of <b>Available</b> packages. To move a package from one list
to the other, simply select it and press the button between the list. When selecting
a package a short description is given at the bottom. Further help is available
by pressing the <b>Help</b> button.

<p>
Extension packages are an extremely powerful part of <i>Game Maker</i>. A few
extension packages are provided with <i>Game Maker</i> but many more will 
become available through the website. To install new packages or uninstall
existing ones, press the <b>Install</b> button. The following form
is shown

<p>

<p>
You will see a list of all extension packages installed. By selecting a package
and clicking the <b>Uninstall</b> button the package is removed from the system.

<p>
Install packages are distributed in the form of a .gex file. You can find
a number of such packages on our website which you can go to by pressing
the button <b>Find More</b>. Once you donwloaded such a package file on
your computer, press the <b>Install</b> button and select the package file.
It will then be installed in the system.

<p>
If you want to create your own extension packages, please check out
