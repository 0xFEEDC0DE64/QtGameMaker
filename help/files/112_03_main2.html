<h3>Main actions, set 2</h3>

Here are some more main actions, dealing with timing, giving messages to the user, 
and dealing with the game as a whole.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_alarm.bmp"> Set Alarm</b><br>
With this action you can set one of the twelve alarm clocks for the instance. 
You select the number of steps and the alarm clock. After the indicated 
number of steps, the instance will receive the corresponding alarm event. 
You can also increase or decrease the value by checking the <b>Relative</b> box.  
If you set the alarm clock to a value less than or equal to 0 you switch it off, 
so the event is not generated.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_sleep.bmp"> Sleep</b><br>
With this action you can freeze the scene for a particular time. 
This is typically used at the beginning or end of a level or when 
you give the player some message. You specify the number of milliseconds to sleep. 
Also you can indicate whether the screen should first be redrawn to 
reflect the most recent situation.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_info.bmp"> Display Message</b><br>
With this action you can display a message in a dialog box. You simply type in 
the message. If you use a # symbol in the message text it will be interpreted 
as a new line character. (Use \# to get the # symbol itself.) If the message 
text starts with a quote or double quote symbol, it is interpreted as an 
expression. See below for more information about expressions. 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_help.bmp"> Show Info</b><br>
With this action you pop up the game information window.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_gamerestart.bmp"> Restart Game</b><br>
With this action you restart the game from the beginning.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_gameend.bmp"> End Game</b><br>
With this action you end the game.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_gamesave.bmp"> Save Game</b><br>
With this action you can save the current game status. You specify the 
filename for saving (the file is created in the working directory for 
the game). Later the game can be loaded with the next action. (Please
realize that only the basic game status is save. Things that are for
example not saved are the current sound that is playing, and advanced
aspects like the contents of data structures, particles, etc.)

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_gameload.bmp"> Load Game</b><br>
Load the game status from a file. You specify the file name. Make sure 
the saved game is for the same game and created with the same version 
of <i>Game Maker</i>. Otherwise an error will occur. (To be precise, 
the game is loaded at the end of the current step. So some actions after 
this one are still executed in the current game, not the loaded one!)
