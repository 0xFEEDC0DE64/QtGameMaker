<h3>Adding tiles</h3>

You can also create so-called tiled background. The idea behind this is as
follows: In many games you will want to have nice looking backgrounds. For
example, in a maze game, the walls of the maze should nicely match up, and
in platform games you like to see beautifully drawn platforms, trees, etc.
You can do this in <i>Game Maker</i> by defining many different objects and
composing your rooms from these objects. The problem though is that this
takes a lot of work, uses large amounts of resources, and makes the games
run slowly because of the many different objects. For example, to create nice
walls in maze games you need as a start 15 differently shaped wall objects.

<p>
The standard way out, used in many games, is that the walls and other static
objects are actually drawn on the background. But, you might ask, how does
the game know that an object hits a wall if it is drawn on the background
only? The trick is as follows: You create just one wall object in your game.
It must have the right size but it does not need to look nice. When creating
the room, place this object at all places where there is a wall. And, here
comes the trick, we make this object invisible. So when playing the game you
don't see the wall objects. You see the beautiful background instead. But
the solid wall objects are still there and the instances in the game will react
to them.

<p>
You can use this technique for any object that is not changing its shape or
position. (You cannot use it when the object must be animated.) For
platform games, you probably need just one floor and one wall object, but
you can make beautifully looking backgrounds where it looks as if you walk
on grass, on tree branches, etc.

<p>
To add tiles to your room you first need to add a background resource to your
game that contains the tiles. 
If you want to have your tiles partially transparent, make sure you
make the background image transparent when loading it. When adding the background resource
indicate that it must be used as a tile set. Next indicate the size of
each tile and whether there is room between the tiles, as was indicated in 
the chapter on background resources.

<p>
Now, when defining your room, click
on the tab <b>tiles</b>. The following form is shown (actually, we already
added some tiles in this room and switched off the grid).

<p>
<img src="images/form_room_tiles.jpg">

<p>
At the left top there is the current set of tiles used. To select the set,
click on the menu button below it and select the appropriate background
image.

<p>
Now you can add tiles by selecting the tile you want at the top left, and
next clicking at the appropriate place in the room at the right. This works
in exactly the same way as for adding instances. Underlying tiles are
removed, unless you uncheck the box <b>Delete underlying</b>. You can use
the right button to delete tiles. Hold the &lt;Shift&gt; key to add multiple
tiles. And hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key to move tiles to a new place. The
&lt;Alt&gt; key will avoid snapping to the gird. Also there is again a pop-
up menu when you hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key and click on a tile with the
right mouse button. The buttons in the toolbar will now clear all tiles,
shift all tiles, sort the tiles or lock/unlock them. (Actually they only
operate on the current layer; see below.)

<p>
In some situations you might want to put a part of the background in the
room that is not exactly the size of a tile or consists of multiple tiles.
This can be done as follows. In the top-left image press the left mouse button
while holding the &lt;Alt&gt; key. Now you can drag an area which you can then 
place in the room in the same way as tiles. To select multiple tiles, hold the
&lt;Shift&gt; key. Note that this only works correctly when there is no
separation between the tiles. If you want to select an area that is multiple
of the room grid size, hold the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key rather than the &lt;Shift&gt; key.
(Note that you can actually change the key you hold during the dragging. This
can sometimes be useful.)

<p>
Tiles can be placed in layers at different depths. At the bottom you see the
current depth. Default this is 1000000 which is normally behind all
instances. So the instances will move in front of the tiles. You can use the
<b>Add</b> button to add new tile layers, each with a different depth.
Negative depths can be used to put tiles in front of instances. If you also
give objects different depths you can put them between different tile
layers. If you press <b>Delete</b> you delete a tile layer together with all
its tiles. (There must always be at least one layer.) If you press <b>Change
</b> you can change the depth of a tile layer. If you give it the same depth
as another layer, the layers are merged.

<p>
Using tiles is a powerful feature that should be used as much as possible.
It is much faster than using objects and the tile images are stored only
once. So you can use large tiled rooms with very little memory consumption.
