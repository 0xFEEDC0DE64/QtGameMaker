<h3>Messages</h3>

The second communication mechanism that <i>Game Maker</i> supports 
is the sending and receiving of messages. A player can send messages 
to one or all other players. Players can see whether messages have 
arrived and take action accordingly. Messages can be sent in a 
guaranteed mode in which you are sure they arrive (but this can be 
slow) or in a non-guaranteed mode, which is faster.

<p>
The following messaging routines exist:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_send(player,id,val)</b></tt> 
    sends a message to the indicated player (either an identifier 
	or a name; use 0 to send the message to all players). id is an 
	integer message identifier and val is the value (either a real 
	or a string). The message is sent in non-guaranteed mode. If val 
	contains a string the maximal string length allowed is 30000 characters.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_send_guaranteed(player,id,val)</b></tt> 
    sends a message to the indicated player (either an identifier 
	or a name; use 0 to send the message to all players). id is an 
	integer message identifier and val is the value (either a real 
	or a string). This is a guaranteed send. If val contains a string 
	the maximal string length allowed is 30000 characters.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_receive(player)</b></tt> 
    receives the next message from the message queue that came from 
	the indicated player (either an identifier or a name). Use 0 for 
	messages from any player. The routine returns whether there was 
	indeed a new message. If so you can use the following routines 
	to get its contents:<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_id()</b></tt> 
    Returns the identifier of  the last received message.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_value()</b></tt> 
    Returns the value of  the last received message.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_player()</b></tt> 
    Returns the player who sent the last received message.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_name()</b></tt> 
    Returns the name of the player who sent the last received message.<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_count(player)</b></tt> 
    Returns the number of messages left in the queue from the player (use 0 to count all message).<br>
  <tt><b>mplay_message_clear(player)</b></tt> 
    Removes all messages left in the queue from the player (use 0 to remove all message).<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
A few remarks are pertinent here. First of all, if you want to send a message 
to a particular player only, you will need to know the player's unique id. 
As indicated earlier you can obtain this with the function <tt>mplay_player_id()</tt>. 
This player identifier is also used when receiving messages from a particular 
player. Alternatively, you can give the name of the player as a string. 
If multiple players have the same name, only the first will get the message.

<p>
Secondly, you might wonder why each message has an integer identifier.
The reason is that this helps your application to send different types of 
messages. The receiver can check the type of message using the id and take 
appropriate actions. (Because messages are not guaranteed to arrive, 
sending id and value in different messages would cause serious problems.)
