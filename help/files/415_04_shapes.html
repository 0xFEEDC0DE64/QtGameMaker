<h3>Drawing basic shapes</h3>

<p>
A number of functions exist for drawing basic shapes, like blocks and walls.
Note that these shapes also work correctly with backface culling on.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>d3d_draw_block(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,texid,hrepeat,vrepeat)</b></tt>
	  Draws a block in the current color with the indicated opposite corners using the indicated
	  texture. Use -1 to not use a texture. <tt>hrepeat</tt> indicates how often the texture must be
	  repeated along the horizontal edge of each face. <tt>vrepeat</tt>
	  does the same for the vertical edge.<br>
  <tt><b>d3d_draw_cylinder(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,texid,hrepeat,vrepeat,closed,steps)</b></tt>
	  Draws a vertical cylinder in the current color in the indicated bounding box using the indicated
	  texture. Use -1 to not use a texture. <tt>hrepeat</tt> indicates how often the texture must be
	  repeated along the horizontal edge of each face. <tt>vrepeat</tt>
	  does the same for the vertical edge. <tt>closed</tt> indicates whether to
	  close the top and bottom of the cylinder. <tt>steps</tt> indicates
	  how many rotational steps must be taken. A typical value is 24.<br>
  <tt><b>d3d_draw_cone(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,texid,hrepeat,vrepeat,closed,steps)</b></tt>
	  Draws a vertical cone in the current color in the indicated bounding box using the indicated
	  texture. Use -1 to not use a texture. <tt>hrepeat</tt> indicates how often the texture must be
	  repeated along the horizontal edge of each face. <tt>vrepeat</tt>
	  does the same for the vertical edge. <tt>closed</tt> indicates whether to
	  close the top and bottom of the cylinder. <tt>steps</tt> indicates
	  how many rotational steps must be taken. A typical value is 24.<br>
  <tt><b>d3d_draw_ellipsoid(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,texid,hrepeat,vrepeat,steps)</b></tt>
	  Draws an ellipsoid in the current color in the indicated bounding box using the indicated
	  texture. Use -1 to not use a texture. <tt>hrepeat</tt> indicates how often the texture must be
	  repeated along the horizontal edge of each face. <tt>vrepeat</tt>
	  does the same for the vertical edge. <tt>steps</tt> indicates
	  how many rotational steps must be taken. A typical value is 24.<br>
  <tt><b>d3d_draw_wall(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,texid,hrepeat,vrepeat)</b></tt>
	  Draws a vertical wall in the current color with the given corners using the indicated
	  texture. Use -1 to not use a texture. <tt>hrepeat</tt> indicates how often the texture must be
	  repeated along the horizontal edge of each face. <tt>vrepeat</tt>
	  does the same for the vertical edge. <br>
  <tt><b>d3d_draw_floor(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2,texid,hrepeat,vrepeat)</b></tt>
	  Draws a (slanted) floor in the current color with the given corners using the indicated
	  texture. Use -1 to not use a texture. <tt>hrepeat</tt> indicates how often the texture must be
	  repeated along the horizontal edge of each face. <tt>vrepeat</tt>
	  does the same for the vertical edge. <br>

<p>
The following piece of code draws two blocks:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
{
  <b>var</b> ttt;
  ttt = background_get_texture(back);
  d3d_draw_block(20,20,20,80,40,200,ttt,1,1);  
  d3d_draw_block(200,300,-10,240,340,100,ttt,1,1);  
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
