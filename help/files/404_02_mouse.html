<h3>The mouse</h3>

For mouse interaction, the following variables and functions exist:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mouse_x*</b></tt> 
    X-coordinate of the mouse in the room. Cannot be changed.<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_y*</b></tt> 
    Y-coordinate of the mouse in the room. Cannot be changed.<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_button</b></tt> 
    Currently pressed mouse button. As value use <tt>mb_none</tt>, <tt>mb_any</tt>, 
	<tt>mb_left</tt>, <tt>mb_middle</tt>, or <tt>mb_right</tt>.<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_lastbutton</b></tt> 
	Last pressed mouse button.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>

To check whether a particular mouse button is pressed you can use the following 
functions. This is in particular useful when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mouse_check_button(numb)</b></tt>
    Returns whether the mouse button is currently down (use as 
	values <tt>mb_none</tt>, <tt>mb_left</tt>, <tt>mb_middle</tt>, or <tt>mb_right</tt>).<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_check_button_pressed(numb)</b></tt>
    Returns whether the mouse button was pressed since the last step.<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_check_button_released(numb)</b></tt>
    Returns whether the mouse button was released since the last step.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>

The following functions can be used to check whether the mouse wheel was used.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mouse_wheel_up()</b></tt>
    Returns whether the mouse wheel was moved up since the last step.<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_wheel_down()</b></tt>
    Returns whether the mouse wheel was moved down since the last step.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are some additional functions related to mouse interaction.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>mouse_clear(button)</b></tt> 
    Clears the state of the mouse button. This means that it will no 
	longer generate mouse events until the player releases it and presses it again.<br>
  <tt><b>io_clear()</b></tt> 
    Clears all keyboard and mouse states.<br>
  <tt><b>io_handle()</b></tt> 
    Handle user io, updating keyboard and mouse status.<br>
  <tt><b>mouse_wait()</b></tt> 
    Waits till the user presses a mouse button<br>.
</blockquote>

<p>
You can change the way the mouse cursor looks like. You can choose any sprite for this. To this 
end you can use the following variable:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>cursor_sprite</b></tt> 
    Indicates the sprite that is used to represent the cursor (default no sprite
	is used, represented by a value of -1). You can assign one of the sprites to this variable to have it been
	drawn automatically at the position of the mouse cursor. (You can also switch
	off the windows mouse cursor in the <b>Global Game Settings</b>.)<br>
