<h1>GML Language overview</h1>

<i>Game Maker</i> contains a built-in programming language. This
programming language gives you much more flexibility and control than the
standard actions. This language we will refer to as GML (the <i>Game Maker
</i> Language). There are a number of different places where you can type
programs in this language. First of all, when you define scripts. A script
is a program in GML. Secondly, when you add a code action to an event. In
a code action you again have to provide a program in GML. Thirdly, in the
room creation code. And finally, wherever you need to specify a value in
an action, you can also use an expression in GML. An expression, as we
will see below is not a complete program, but a piece of code resulting in a
value.

<p>
In this chapter we will describe the basic structure of programs in GML.
When you want to use programs in GML, there are a couple of things you
have to be careful about. First of all, for all your resources (sprites,
objects, sounds, etc.) you must use names that start with a letter and
only consist of letters, digits and the underscore '_' symbol. Otherwise
you cannot refer to them from within the program. Make sure all resources
have different names. Also be careful not to name resources self, other,
global, or all because these have special meaning in the language. Also
you should not use any of the keywords, indicated below.
