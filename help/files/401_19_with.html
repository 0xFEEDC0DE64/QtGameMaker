<h3>With constructions</h3>

As indicated before, it is possible to read and change the value of
variables in other instances. But in a number of cases you want to do a
lot more with other instances. For example, imagine that you want to move
all balls 8 pixels down. You might think that this is achieved by the
following piece of code

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ball.y = ball.y + 8;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
But this is not correct. The right side of the assignment gets the value
of the y-coordinate of the first ball and adds 8 to it. Next this new
value is set as y-coordinate of all balls. So the result is that all balls
get the same y-coordinate. The statement

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>ball.y += 8;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
will have exactly the same effect because it is simply an abbreviation of
the first statement. So how do we achieve this? For this purpose there is
the <b>with</b> statement. Its global form is

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>with</b> (&lt;expression&gt;) &lt;statement&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
&lt;expression&gt; indicates one or more instances. For this you can use
an instance id, the name of an object (to indicate all instances of this
object) or one of the special objects (all, self, other, noone).
&lt;statement&gt; is now executed for each of the indicated instances, as
if that instance is the current (self) instance. So, to move all balls 8
pixels down, you can type.

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>with</b> (ball) y += 8;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you want to execute multiple statements, put curly brackets around
them. So for example, to move all balls to a random position, you can use

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>with</b> (ball)
{
  x = random(room_width);
  y = random(room_height);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that, within the statement(s), the indicated instance has become the
self instance. Within the statements the original self instance has become
the other instance. So for example, to move all balls to the position of
the current instance, you can type

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>with</b> (ball)
{
  x = other.x;
  y = other.y;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Use of the with statement is extremely powerful. Let me give a few more
examples. To destroy all balls you type

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>with</b> (ball) instance_destroy();</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If a bomb explodes and you want to destroy all instances close by you can
use

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>with</b> (all)
{
  <b>if</b> (distance_to_object(other) &lt; 50) instance_destroy();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
