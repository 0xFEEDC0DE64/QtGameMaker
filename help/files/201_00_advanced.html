<h1>Advanced mode</h1>

Up to now we have only considered the simple features of <i>Game Maker</i>. But there are a lot more 
possibilities. To be able to use these you must run <i>Game Maker</i> in advanced mode. 
This is easy to change. In the <b>File</b> menu, click on the menu item <b>Advanced mode</b>. 
(To fully see the effects you should restart <i>Game Maker</i> or at least save your 
game and load it anew.)

<p>
When you start <i>Game Maker</i> in advanced mode, the following form is shown:

<p>

<p>
It contains all that was there in simple mode, but there are a number 
of additional resources, buttons, and menu items. Also, as we will see 
in the chapters that follow, the different resources have additional options. 
Here we will discuss the additional menu items.


<h3>File menu</h3>

In the file menu you can find the following additional commands:

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Publish your Game.</b> 
    This command will take you to our website were you can easily upload and publish
	your finished game such that everybody can play it. Carefully follow the
	instructions to make your game available. Please only use this for finished games,
	not for preliminary versions.
	<b><i>This possibility is only available in the Pro Edition.</i></b> 
	</li>
  <li><b>Import Resources.</b> 
    With this command you can import resources that you exported with the
	next command. See the section on <a href="216_00_import.html">Exporting and Importing Resources</a>
	for more details.</li>
  <li><b>Export Resources.</b> 
    With this command you can export resources to a file.
	See the section on <a href="216_00_import.html">Exporting and Importing Resources</a>
	for more details.</li>
  <li><b>Preferences.</b> 
    Here you can set a number of preferences about 
    <i>Game Maker</i>. They will be remembered between different calls 
	of <i>Game Maker</i>. For more information see the page on <A HREF="201_01_preferences.html">Preferences</A>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Edit menu</h3>

In the edit menu you can find the following additional commands:

<ul>
  <li><b>Add group.</b> 
    Resources can be grouped together. 
    This is very useful when you make large games. For example, you can 
	put all sounds related to a certain object in a group, or you can group all 
	objects that are used in a particular level. This command creates a new group 
	in the currently selected resource type. You will be asked for a name. 
	Groups can again contain groups, etc. You can drag 
	resources into the groups.</li>
  <li><b>Find Resource.</b> 
    With this command you type in the name 
    of a resource and it open the corresponding property form.</li>
  <li><b>Expand Resource Tree.</b> 
    Fully expands the resource tree, showing all resources.</li>
  <li><b>Collapse Resource Tree.</b> 
    Fully collapses the resource tree, hiding all resources.</li>
  <li><b>Show Object Information.</b> 
    Using this command you can get an overview of all objects in the game.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Resources menu</h3>

In this menu you can now also create the additional resources. Note that 
for each of them there is also a button on the toolbar and a keyboard 
shortcut. There are three special menu items at the bottom:

<ul>
  <li><b>Define Constants.</b> 
    Here you can define constants for use in your scripts and action arguments.
	For more information see the section on <a href="207_00_constants.html">Constants</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Define Triggers.</b> 
    Here you can define your own trigger events.
	For more information see the section on <a href="208_00_triggers.html">Trigger Events</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Included Files.</b> 
    Here you can indicate which additional files should be included in the game executable.
	For more information see the section on <a href="209_00_include.html">Including Files</a>.</li>
</ul>

In the scripts menu you can find the following additional commands:

<ul>
  <li><b>Import Scripts.</b> 
    Can be used to import useful scripts from files.</li>
  <li><b>Export Scripts.</b> 
    Can be used to save your scripts in a file, to be used by others. 
	When you select a script resource only this script is saved. When 
	you select a group all scripts in the group are saved. When you 
	select the root resource (or a different type of resource) all scripts 
	are saved. This menu item is also available when right-clicking on a 
	script or group of scripts.</li>

	defined in the game options.</li>

	particular resource for editing.</li>
  <li><b>Search in Scripts.</b> 
    You can search for a string in all scripts. You can click on one of 
	the reported places to move there for editing.</li>
  <li><b>Check Resource Names.</b>
