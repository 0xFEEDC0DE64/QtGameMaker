<h3>More move actions</h3>

Some additional move actions are available in advanced mode. The following actions are added:

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_path.bmp"> Set Path</b><br>
With this action you can specify that the instance should follow a particular path. 
You indicate the path that must be followed and the speed in pixels per step. 
When the speed is positive the instance starts at the beginning of the path. 
If it is negative it starts at the end. Next you specify the end behavior, 
that is, what should happen when the end of the path is reached. You can 
choose to stop the motion, restart from the beginning, restart from the current 
position (which is the same when the path is closed), or reverse the motion. 
Finally you can indicate that the path must be seen as absolute, that is, the 
position will be as indicated in the path (this is useful when you have designed 
the path at a particular place in the room) or relative, in which case the start 
point of the path is placed at the current location of the instance (end point 
when speed is negative). See the chapter on paths for more information.

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_pathend.bmp"> End Path</b><br>
Use this action to stop the path for the instance. 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_pathposition.bmp"> Path Position</b><br>
With this action you can change the current position of the instance in the path. 
This must be a value between 0 and 1 (0=beginning, 1=end). 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_pathspeed.bmp"> Path Speed</b><br>
With this action you can change the speed of the instance on the path. 
A negative speed moves the instance backwards along the path. Set it to 0 to 
temporarily stop the motion along the path. 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_steplinear.bmp" > Step Towards</b><br>
This action should be placed in the step event to let the instance take a step 
towards a particular position. When the instance is already at the position it 
will not move any further. You specify the position to move to, the speed with 
which to move, that is, the size of the step, and whether the motion should stop 
when hitting a solid instance or when hitting any instance. 

<p>
<b><img src="images/action_steppotential.bmp"> Step Avoiding</b><br>
This is a very powerful motion action. It should be placed in the step event. 
Like the previous action it lets the instance take a step towards a particular 
position. But in this case it tries to avoid obstacles. When the instance would 
run into a solid instance (or any instance) it will change the direction of 
motion to try to avoid the instance and move around it. The approach is not 
guaranteed to work but in most easy cases it will effectively move the instance 
towards the goal. For more complicated cases, there are motion planning functions. 
You specify the position to move to, the speed with which to move, that is, the 
size of the step, and whether the motion should avoid solid instances or any instance.
