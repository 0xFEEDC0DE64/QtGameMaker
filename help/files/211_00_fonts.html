<h1>Fonts</h1>

When you want to draw text in your game this text is drawn in an Arial 12 points font. To make more fancy
looking texts you probably want to use different fonts.  To use different fonts you must create font resources.
In each font resource you specify a particular type of font which can then be used in your game using the
action to set a font.

<p>
To create a font resource in your game, use the item <b>Create Font</b> in the <b>Resources</b> menu or use 
the corresponding button on the toolbar. The following form will pop up.

As always you should give your font resource a name. Next you can pick the name of the font. Also you can
indicate its size and whether it should be bold and/or italic. Realize that large fonts take a lot of 
memory to store. So you are strongly recommended not to use fonts with a size larger than say 32. (It
is possible to scale the fonts while running the game.) An example of the indicated font is shown at the bottom.

<p>
A font typically consist of 256 characters, numbered from 0 to 255. 
But in general you use only a small portion of
these. So default in a font only the characters from 32 till 127 are stored in the font. The more characters you
store in the font the more memory it will use. You can change the character range used. To see the index of
each character you can use the Character Map that can be found in the 
Windows Start menu under Accessories/System Tools.
Some standard ranges can be indicated using the buttons: The <b>Normal</b> range from 32 till 127, the <b>All</b>
range from 0 till 255, the <b>Digits</b> range that only contains the 10 digits, and the <b>Letters</b>
range that contains all uppercase and lowercase letters. Other ranges can be used by typing in the 
first and last character index. If a character does not lie in the range it is replaced by a space. 

<p>
Normally you have a large number of different fonts
installed on your computer and there are websites where you can download hundreds more. The problem is that
if you use them in your game and then give your game to somebody else to play there is a big chance that
the other person does not have the same fonts installed on his or her computer. 
To avoid this, <i>Game Maker</i> embeds all the fonts you want to use in the game file, but only in
the stand-alone games. So if you give a stand-alone game to someone else you don't need to provide
the font files. But if you give somebody the editable version of your game and you use fancy fonts, you
better also provide the person with the correct font files.
