<h3>Executing programs</h3>

<i>Game Maker</i> also has the possibility to start external programs. 
There are two functions available for this: execute_program and execute_
shell. The function execute_program starts a program, possibly with some 
arguments. It can wait for the program to finish (pausing the game) or 
continue the game. The function execute_shell opens a file. This can be 
any file for which some association is defined, e.g. an html-file, a word 
file, etc. Or it can be a program. It cannot wait for completion so the 
game will continue.

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>execute_program(prog,arg,wait)</b></tt> 
    Executes program prog with arguments arg. wait indicates whether to wait for finishing.<br>
  <tt><b>execute_shell(prog,arg)</b></tt>
     Executes the program (or file) in the shell.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Both functions will not work if the player sets the secure mode 
in the preferences. You can check this using the read-only variable:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>secure_mode*</b></tt> 
    Whether the game is running in secure mode.<br>
</blockquote>
