<h3>Using expressions and variables</h3>

In many actions you need to provide values for parameters. Rather than just 
typing a number, you can also type a formula, e.g. 32*12. But you can actually 
type much more complicated expressions. For example, if you want to double the 
horizontal speed, you could set it to <tt>2*hspeed</tt>. Here <tt>hspeed</tt> is a 
variable indicating the current horizontal speed of the instance.  
There are a large number of other variables that you can use. 
Some of the most important ones are:

<p>
<blockquote>
	<b>x</b> the x-coordinate of the instance<br>
	<b>y</b> the y-coordinate of the instance<br>
	<b>hspeed</b> the horizontal speed (in pixels per step)<br>
	<b>vspeed</b> the vertical speed (in pixels per step)<br>
	<b>direction</b> the current direction of motion in degrees (0-360)<br>
	<b>speed</b> the current speed in this direction<br>
	<b>visible</b> whether the object is visible (1) or invisible (0)<br>
	<b>image_index</b> this variable indicate which subimage in the current sprite is currently shown.
	  If you change it and set the speed to 0 (see below) you can display a fixed subimage.<br>
	<b>image_speed</b> this variable indicates the speed with which the subimages are shown.
	  The default value is 1. If you make this value larger than 1 some subimages 
	  are skipped to make the animation faster. If you make it 
	  smaller than 1 the animation becomes slower by repeating subimages.<br>
	<b>score</b> the current value of the score<br>
	<b>lives</b> the current number of lives<br>
	<b>health</b> the current health (0-100)<br>
	<b>mouse_x</b> x-position of the mouse<br>
	<b>mouse_y</b> y-position of the mouse<br>
</blockquote>

You can change most of these variables using the set variable action.
You can also define your own variables by setting them to a value. 
(Don't use relative, because they don't exist yet.) Then you can use these 
variables in expressions. Variables you create are local to the current 
instance. That is, each object has its own copy of them. To create a global 
variable, put the word global and a dot in front of it.

<p>
You can also refer to the values of variables for other objects 
by putting the object name and a dot in front of them. So for example, 
if you want a ball to move to the place where the coin is you can 
set the position to (<tt>coin.x</tt> , <tt>coin.y</tt>). In the 
case of a collision event you can refer to the x-coordinate of the 
other object as <tt>other.x</tt>. In conditional expressions you 
can use comparisons like &lt; (smaller than), &gt;, etc.

<p>
In your expressions you can also use functions. For example, the function 
<tt>random(10)</tt> gives a random integer number below 10. So you can 
set for example the speed or direction of motion to a random value. 
Many more functions exist. They are described in <A HREF="400_index.html">Part 4</A> of the
documentation.
