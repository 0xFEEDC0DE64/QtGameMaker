<h1>Getting started</h1>

<p>
Creating your first game is always a challenge. But if you are willing to
put a little bit of effort in it, it will actually be rather easy. You can
have it running within an hour.
</p>

<p>
Even though it is really easy to make games with <i>Game Maker</i> you will
need to understand some of the basic concepts. To this end you are strongly
recommended to follow the tutorial that is shown when <i>Game Maker</i> is started.
If you did remove the tutorial from view, you can always make it visible again
by choosing <b>Tutorial</b> in the <b>Help</b> menu.
</p>

<h3>The Global idea</h3>
<p>
Before delving into the possibilities of <i>Game Maker</i> it is good to
get a feeling for the global idea behind the program. Games created
with <i>Game Maker</i> take place in one or more <i>rooms</i>. (Rooms are
flat, not 3D, but they can contain 3D-looking graphics.) In these rooms
you place <i>objects</i>, which you can define in the program. Typical
objects are the walls, moving balls, the main character, monsters, etc.
Some objects, like walls, just sit there and don’t do anything. Other
objects, like the main character, will move around and react to input
from the player (keyboard, mouse, and joystick) and to each other. For
example, when the main character meets a monster he might die. Objects
are the most important ingredients of games made with <i>Game Maker</i>,
so let us talk a bit more about them. 
</p>

<p>
First of all, most objects need some image to make them visible on the
screen. Such images are called <i>sprites</i>. A sprite is often not a
single image but a set of images that are shown one after the other to
create an animation. In this way it looks like the character walks, a
ball rotates, a spaceship explodes, etc. During the game, the sprite for a
particular object can change. (So the character can look different when
it walks to the left or to the right.) You can create you own sprites in
<i>Game Maker</i> or load them from files (e.g. PNG files or animated GIF’s).
Many sprites come bundled with <i>Game Maker</i> that you can use free
of charge in your games.
</p>

<p>
Certain things will happen to objects. Such happenings are called <i>
events</i>. Objects can take certain <i>actions</i> when events happen.
There are a large number of different events that can take place and a
large number of different actions that you can let your objects take. For
example, there is a <i>creation event</i> when the object gets created.
(To be more precise, when an instance of an object gets created; there
can be multiple instances of the same object.) For example, when a ball
object gets created you can give it some motion action so that it
starts moving. When two objects meet, you get a <i>collision event</i>. In
such a case you can make the ball stop or reverse direction. You can also
play a sound effect. To this end <i>Game Maker</i> lets you define <i>
sounds</i>. When the player presses a key on the keyboard there is a <i>
keyboard event</i>, and the object can take an appropriate action, like
moving in the direction indicated. We hope you get the idea. For each
object you design, you can indicate actions for various events; in this
way defining the behavior of the object.
</p>

<p>
Once you have defined your objects it is time to define the <i>rooms</i>
in which they will live. Rooms can be used for levels in your game or to
check out different places. There are actions to move from one room to
another. Rooms, first of all, have a <i>background</i>. This can be a
simple color or an image. Such background images can be created in <i>
Game Maker</i> or you can load them from files. (The background can do a
lot of things but for the time being, just consider it as something that
makes the rooms look nice.) Next, you can place the objects in the room.
You can place multiple instances of the same object in a room. So, for
example, you need to define just one wall object and can use it at many
places. Also you can have multiple instances of the same monster objects,
as long as they have the same behavior.
</p>

<p>
Now you are ready to run the game. The first room will be shown and
objects will come to life because of the actions in their creation
events. They will start reacting to each other due to actions in
collision events and they can react to the player using the actions in
keyboard or mouse events.
</p>

<p>
So in summary, the following things (often called resources) play a
crucial role:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>objects</i>: which are the true entities in the game</li>
  <li><i>rooms</i>: the places (levels) in which the objects live</li>
  <li><i>sprites</i>: (animated) images that are used to represent the objects</li>
  <li><i>sounds</i>: these can be used in games, either as background music or as effects</li>
  <li><i>backgrounds</i>: the images used as background for the rooms</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are actually a number of other types of resources: paths, scripts,
fonts, and time lines. These are only important for more complicated
games. You will only see them when you run <i>Game Maker</i> in advanced
mode. They will be treated in the advanced chapters later in this
document.
