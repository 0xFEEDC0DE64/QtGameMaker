<h3>Sprites and images</h3>

Each object has a sprite associated with it. This is either a single image or it consists
of multiple images. For each instance of the object the program draws the corresponding
image on the screen, with its origin (as defined in the sprite properties) at the position
(x,y) of the instance. When there are multiple images, it cycles through the images to get
an animation effect. There are a number of variables that affect the way the image is
drawn. These can be used to change the effects. Each instance has the following variables:

<p>
<blockquote>
  <tt><b>visible</b></tt> 
  	If visible is true (1) the image is drawn, otherwise it is not
	drawn. Invisible instances are still active and create collision events; only you don't
	see them. Setting the visibility to false is useful for e.g. controller objects (make them
	non-solid to avoid collision events) or hidden switches.<br>
  <tt><b>sprite_index</b></tt> 
  	This is the index of the current sprite for the instance.
	You can change it to give the instance a different sprite. As value you can use the names
	of the different sprites you defined. Changing the sprite does not change the index of the
	currently visible subimage.<br>
  <tt><b>sprite_width*</b></tt> 
  	Indicates the width of the sprite. This value cannot be
	changed but you might want to use it.<br>
  <tt><b>sprite_height*</b></tt> 
  	Indicates the height of the sprite. This value cannot be
	changed but you might want to use it.<br>
  <tt><b>sprite_xoffset*</b></tt> 
  	Indicates the horizontal offset of the sprite as defined
	in the sprite properties. This value cannot be changed but you might want to use it.<br>
  <tt><b>sprite_yoffset*</b></tt> 
  	Indicates the vertical offset of the sprite as defined
	in the sprite properties. This value cannot be changed but you might want to use it.<br>
  <tt><b>image_number*</b></tt> 
  	The number of subimages for the current sprite for the
	instance (cannot be changed).<br>
  <tt><b>image_index</b></tt> 
  	When the image has multiple subimages the program cycles
	through them. This variable indicates the currently drawn subimage (they are numbered
	starting from 0). You can change the current image by changing this variable. The program
	will continue cycling, starting at this new index. (The value can have a fractional part. 
	In this case it is always rounded down to obtain the subimage that is drawn.)<br>
  <tt><b>image_speed</b></tt> 
  	The speed with which we cycle through the subimages. A value of 1 indicates that each step we 
	get the next image. Smaller values will switch subimages slower, drawing each subimage multiple 
	times. Larger values will skip subimages to make the motion faster. Sometimes you want a 
	particular subimage to be visible and don't want the program to cycle through all of them. 
	This can be achieved by setting the speed to 0 and choosing the correct subimage. For example, 
	assume you have an object that can rotate and you create a sprite that has subimages for a
	number of orientations (counter-clockwise). Then, in the step event of the object you can set
        <blockquote>
<pre>
{
  image_index = direction * image_number/360;
  image_speed = 0;
}
</pre>
		</blockquote>
  <tt><b>depth</b></tt> 
  	Normally images are drawn in the order in which the instances are
	created. You can change this by setting the image depth. The default value is 0, unless
	you set it to a different value in the object properties. The higher the value the further
	the instance is away. (You can also use negative values.) Instances with higher depth will
	lie behind instances with a lower depth. Setting the depth will guarantee that the
	instances are drawn in the order you want (e.g. the plane in front of the cloud).
	Background instances should have a high (positive) depth, and foreground instances should
	have a low (negative) depth.<br>
  <tt><b>image_xscale</b></tt> 
  	A scale factor to make larger or smaller images. A value of 1 indicates the normal size. 
	You must separately set the horizontal xscale and vertical yscale. Changing the scale 
	also changes the values for the image width and height and influences collision events 
	as you might expect. Changing the scale can be used to get a 3-D effect. You can use 
	a value of -1 to mirror the sprite horizontally.<br>
  <tt><b>image_yscale</b></tt> 
  	The vertical yscale. 1 is no scaling. You can use a value of -1 
	to flip the sprite vertically.<br>
  <tt><b>image_angle</b></tt> 
    The angle with which the sprite is rotated. You specify this in degrees, 
	counterclockwise. A value of 0 indicates no rotation. 
	<b><i>This variable can only be set in the Pro Edition!</i></b><br>
  <tt><b>image_alpha</b></tt> 
  	Transparency (alpha) value to use when drawing the image. 
	A value of 1 is the normal opaque setting; a value of 0 is completely transparent.<br>
  <tt><b>image_blend</b></tt> 
  	Blending color used when drawing the sprite. A value of c_white is the default. 
	When you specify a different value the image is blended with this color. This 
	can be used to colorize the sprite on the fly.
	<b><i>This variable can only be set in the Pro Edition!</i></b><br>
  <tt><b>bbox_left*</b></tt> 
  	Left side of the bounding box of the instance in the room, as defined by its image (taking scaling into account).<br>
  <tt><b>bbox_right*</b></tt> 
  	Right side of the bounding box of the instance in the room.<br>
  <tt><b>bbox_top*</b></tt> 
  	Top side of the bounding box of the instance in the room.<br>
  <tt><b>bbox_bottom*</b></tt> 
  	Bottom side of the bounding box of the instance in the room.<br>
