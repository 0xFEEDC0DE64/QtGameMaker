<h1>Changing resources</h1>

<i><b>This functionality is only available in the Pro Edition of Game Maker.</b></i>

<P>
It is possible to create new resources during the game. Also you can change existing 
resources. This chapter describes the possibilities. Be warned though. <b>Changing 
resources easily leads to serious errors in your games!!!</b> You must follow the 
following rules when changing resources:

<ul>
  <li>Don't change resources that are being used. This will lead to errors! For example, 
	don't change a sprite that is being used by an instance.</li>
  <li>When you save the game during playing, added and changed resources are NOT stored 
	with the save game. So if you load the saved game later, these might not be there anymore. 
	In general, when you manipulate resources you can no longer use the built-in system for 
	loading and saving games.</li>
  <li>When you restart the game during playing, the changed resources are NOT restored to 
	their original shape. In general, when you manipulate resources you can no longer use the 
	action or function to restart the game.</li>
  <li>Resource manipulation can be slow. For example, changing sprites or backgrounds is 
	relatively slow. So don't use it during the game play.</li>
  <li>Creating resources during game play (in particular sprites and background) easily 
	uses huge amount of memory. So be extremely careful with this. For example, if you have a 
	32 frame 128x128 animated sprite and you decide to create 36 rotated copies of it you will 
	use up 36x32x128x128x4 = 72 MB of memory!</li>
  <li>Make sure you delete resources you no longer need. Otherwise the system soon runs 
	out of memory.</li>
</ul>

In general, you should not change any resources during game play. Better create and change 
the resources at the beginning of the game or maybe at the beginning of a room.
